# Purpose: Print the meaning of some of the arguments in a simple command-line.{{{
#
# Example:
#
#     $ explain-shell ls -larth
#     ls      List directory contents
#
#     SYNOPSIS
#            ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
#
#     ARGUMENTS
#     -l      Long listing format
#
#     -a      Show hidden
#
#     -r      Reverse sort order
#
#     -t      Sort by modified time, most recent first
#
#     -h      Human readable sizes
#}}}
# The script fails to print the descriptions of some options!{{{
#
# The script relies on fish being able to complete the given command.
# But maybe fish has no completion for your command.
#
# First, make sure a man page for the command is currently installed on your system.
# If the devs do not provide one, they might at least have some documentation in
# a markdown file.  If you can find one, you might use `pandoc(1)` to generate a
# man page:
#
#     $ pandoc --standalone --from=markdown-smart --to=man /path/to/some_doc.md --output=/path/to/my-cmd.1
#     $ cp /path/to/my-cmd.1 ~/.local/share/man/man1/
#
# *That's how `translate-shell(1)` generates its man page:*
# https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell/blob/1e3f901c479fc4f838b290f11e1b547b86bdadd4/build.awk#L49
#
# Once you have a man page, ask fish to generate a completion out of it:
#
#     $ fish_update_completions
#
# The fish completion should be put in:
#
#     ~/.local/share/fish/generated_completions/
