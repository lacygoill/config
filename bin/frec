# Terminology: "frequencies" are not "scores".{{{

# The frequencies are *written* in the third field of the database.
# The scores (or  frecencies) are *computed* at runtime  by `$QUERY_SCRIPT` with
# some formula which contains the frequencies:
#
#     printf "%-10s %s\n", frequency[path] * recency_factor(last_seen[path]), path
#
# They  are used  to  sort the  entries  by frecency  (which  combines both  the
# frequency *and* the recency).
#}}}

# If  the  sum  of all  frequencies  in  the  database  goes beyond  this  given
# threshold, `ADD_SCRIPT`  applies a malus to  each of them.  This  is what fasd
# does with `_FASD_MAX`.  I guess the purpose is to prevent the frequencies from
# increasing too much.
#
# TODO: Or maybe the purpose is to forget the least used paths.
#
#    > When the sum of ranks is over 5000 ($_ZL_MAXAGE), all ranks are multiplied by 0.9.
#    > Entries with a rank lower than 1 are forgotten.
#
# Source: https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua#features
# Do we want such a mechanism?
# Did fasd support such a mechanism?
#
# But wait.  Suppose  a path has just  been added with the frequency  1.  If the
# frequency gets immediately multiplied  by 0.9, it will be lower  than 1 and be
# forgotten, which is obviously not what anyone would want.  What gives?
