# The code is a little complex because it tries to support multiline commands:
#
#     /some \
#       long \
#       command
#
# As well as comments inside:
#
#     /some \
#       # comment
#       command
#
# First, let's delete comments.{{{
#
# Note that right after  the comment leader, there might be  nothing, a Vim fold
# marker, a space, or some exotic space (like a no-break space).

  # Then, join backslash-continued lines.{{{

  # Here, we need `P; D` because `N`  might have loaded a different command, and
  # not the continuation of the current one.

  # Alternative:

  #     | sed '/^\//! d; :loop; /\\$/ { N; s/\\\n\s*//; t loop }'
