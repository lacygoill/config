# TODO: Validate and restore-test backups.
#
# TODO: Save up to 10 (?) backups in case the file we're looking for was wrongly
# deleted recently, and we need an old backup to restore it.
#
# TODO: Achieve immutability:  neither a hacker,  nor a bogus process  should be
# able to corrupt, modify, or delete our backups.
#
# I guess  it means to compute  some kind of  hash of our backup,  and regularly
# making  sure that  hash doesn't  change.   But that  also means  that we  need
# to  be  sure  that  nobody  tampers  with whatever  file  we  store  the  hash
# into.   This  looks familiar  to  the  issue that  `apt(8)`  has  to solve  in
# `/var/lib/apt/lists/*InRelease`;  try  to  draw   some  inspiration  from  the
# solution it uses.  From `~/Wiki/linux/Debian.md`:
#
#    > - a trusted GPG key authenticates an `*InRelease` file (via an in-line signature)
#    > - a SHA256 hash from `*InRelease` authenticates a `*Packages` file
#    > - a SHA256 hash from `*Packages` authenticates a `.deb` file
#
# I guess  we need  a manifest, which  includes one or  several hashes  (for the
# overall backup or for each file inside) as well as an in-line signature.
#
# TODO: Encrypt and send the backup to a remote server.
# Keep the encryption key on a  dedicated-purpose machine (on our home network?)
# that only gets booted (automatically?) when you need to back up.
#
# That's in addition to a local storage device: we need redundancy.

# There are many ways to specify the source(s) and destination.
# How does `rsync(1)` process them exactly?{{{
#
# First,  it changes  its CWD  to the  specified destination.   Then, from  each
# source path argument, it skips over the  longest path to a directory, with the
# internal  definition that  a directory  must end  with a  slash.  Finally,  it
# restores files/directories from whatever path remains (in its CWD).
#
# For example:
#
#             options
#             vvv
#     $ rsync ... /path/to/source dest
#                          ^----^
#                          let's assume that's a directory, and not a file
#
# Here, `rsync(1)`:
#
#    - changes its CWD to `dest/`
#    - skips over `/path/to/` from the source argument because it's the longest
#      path to a directory ending with a slash
#    - creates `source/`, because that's what remains from the source argument
#      now, and copies all its contents inside `dest/`
#
# Another example:
#
#                                v
#     $ rsync ... /path/to/source/ dest
#
# Here, `rsync(1)`:
#
#    - changes its CWD to `dest/`
#    - skips over `/path/to/source/` from the source argument
#    - copies the contents of the source directly inside `dest/`
#}}}
# What about trailing slashes?  When do they matter?{{{
#
# They don't matter for the destination path.
#
# But they do for the source(s).
#
#     $ cd /tmp
#     $ mkdir -p orig/dir backup
#     $ touch orig/{a,dir/b}
#
#                           v
#     $ rsync --archive orig/ backup; tree backup; rm -r backup/*
#     backup
#     ├── a
#     └── dir
#         └── b
#
#                          v
#     $ rsync --archive orig backup; tree backup; rm -r backup/*
#     backup
#     └── orig
#         ├── a
#         └── dir
#             └── b
#
# Notice that when  you append a slash  to `orig/`, only its  contents is copied
# into `backup/`.   OTOH, if you omit  the slash, `orig/` itself  is copied into
# `backup/`.
#}}}

# What do "ir-chk" and "to-chk" mean in rsync's output?{{{
#
# rsync  doesn't know  immediately how  many files  it has  to back  up.  That's
# because  it has  to recurse  into directories  (we specify  `--archive`, which
# implies `--recursive`).
#
# And yet, it prints and updates a temporary number during the transfer:
#
#     ... (xfr#..., ir-chk=123/456)
#                   ^^
#
# Here, rsync tells us that it has still 123 files to back up out of 456 in total.
#
# That's possible because  it simultaneously scan the list of  files to back up:
# it performs  an "**i**ncremental **r**ecursion **ch**ec**k**".  At  some point
# during the transfer, the scan will end, and rsync will know the **to**tal list
# of  files it  needs to  back  up; that's  when  it switches  from "ir-chk"  to
# "to-chk":
#
#     ... (xfr#..., to-chk=123/789)
#                   ^^
#
# As long  as you can  read "ir-chk", the  total count of  files to back  up can
# still increase.

# `--archive`: recurse and preserve almost everything
# `--delete`: delete a file which no longer exists in the sources{{{
#
# It's a dangerous option.
#
# For example, if you've backed up `foo/`, then later want to update the backup,
# but wrongly  specify `bar/`  as the  source, `foo/` will  be deleted  from the
# backup.  The  risk is  low if you  use it in  a script,  where a typo  is less
# likely than in an interactive shell (you only write a script once), but still,
# be cautious.
#
# Whether it should be used depends on  how you want to handle your sources.  If
# you're only interested in their  *present* contents, then you need `--delete`;
# but if  you're also  interested in  their *past* contents  (a source  could no
# longer exist, or just some of its files), then you must avoid `--delete`.
#
# We use it here, because it prevents keeping stale files which might take a lot
# of space (e.g. music which we liked, but no longer listen to...).
#}}}
# `--exclude`: ignore files which take too much space and are usually not important{{{
#
# BTW if you want to exclude a directory,  and not a file, append a slash to its
# pattern:
#
#     --exclude=dir/
#                  ^
#
# Without, a file named `dir` would be wrongly excluded too.
#}}}
# `--human-readable`: output numbers in human-readable format
# `--info=progress2`: draw progress bar during transfer
# `--one-file-system`: don't cross filesystem boundaries when recursing
# `--partial`: keep partially transferred files{{{
#
# By default,  a partially  transferred file is  deleted. `--partial`  keeps it,
# which  helps after  a transfer  has  been interrupted;  next time,  `rsync(1)`
# doesn't have to re-transfer the whole file, but only what the missing part.
#}}}
# `--relative`: useful to back up several sources at different levels {{{
#
# Several sources  might have  the same  last path component,  and even  if they
# don't, at  restoration time, you'll  need to remember  where each of  them was
# originally.
#
# `--relative`  helps by  preserving  the intermediate  directories between  the
# sources' root down to the  sources themselves (aka "implied directories").  It
# no longer  matters if  2 sources  have the same  last path  component; they're
# isolated in  their own implied directories.   And at restoration time,  you no
# longer have  to remember where  each source was  originally; you just  need to
# remember where their common root was.
#
# For example, files in `~/Documents` are located on level 4.  And their root is
# `$HOME`.  With `--relative`, you get:
#
#     $BACKUP
#     ├── Documents
#     │   └── ...
#
# `Documents` is an implied directory.
#
# ---
#
# Technically, instead  of skipping over  the longest  path to a  directory from
# each source argument, `rsync(1)` no longer skips any path component:
#
#                 v--------v
#     $ rsync ... --relative /path/to/source "$BACKUP"
#
# Here, `rsync(1)`:
#
#    - changes its CWD to `$BACKUP`
#    - re-creates the tree hierarchy `path/to/source` inside `$BACKUP`, then
#      copies the contents of `/path/to/source/` inside `$BACKUP/path/to/source/`

#}}}
# `--rsh='ssh -p <port>'`: use SSH with different port than the default one
# `--update`: do not transfer a file if it exists on the destination, and is newer over there{{{
#
# I prefer to avoid this.  Suppose we create  a file (A), trash it, create a new
# version (B), back it up, then realize  that actually A was good and should not
# have been trashed; we restore it, which overwrites B.  During the next backup,
# `--update` will cause `rsync(1)`  to skip A because it will  be older than the
# backed up  B.  We  will need  to wait  until we edit  A to  get a  more recent
# version (assuming we ever edit it).  It's easy to miss that A was skipped, and
# the day we  use the backup, we'll  restore B whose contents  is wrong.  That's
# not OK; we  want `rsync(1)` to back up  our sources as they are  right now, no
# matter what the backup directory contains.
#}}}
# `--verbose`: equivalent to `--info=flist,name,stats` (at least I *think*)
# `--verbose --verbose`: no idea to which `--info=FLAGS` it's equivalent (but it's valid)

# Options to avoid.
# -----------------
# `--compress`: compress file data during transfer {{{
#
# First, `--compress` is meant to reduce the amount of data transfer required to
# copy a file, which only makes sense if your backup is on a remote machine, and
# your upload is slow or the latency between the hosts is high.  That's probably
# not our case; for  the moment, we intend to create our  backups on a removable
# storage device (typically a USB drive).
#
# Second, we  care much more  about our  CPU usage; we  want to consume  as less
# electricity as possible, and we don't  want our OS to get degraded performance
# while the files are compressed.
#
# Third, `--compress`  works well on  text files, but  not on media  files (e.g.
# music, movies, ...). This can be confirmed by reading the "speedup" factor:
#
#     speedup = (bytes sent + bytes received)/total size
#
# ATM, when  we use `--compress` for  files in `~/Documents/`, we  get a speedup
# factor of 2.40:
#
#     sent 13.68K bytes  received 229 bytes  27.81K bytes/sec
#     total size is 33.34K  speedup is 2.40
#                                      ^--^
#
# Compared to 0.97 without:
#
#     sent 34.16K bytes  received 229 bytes  68.79K bytes/sec
#     total size is 33.34K  speedup is 0.97
#                                      ^--^
#
# This confirms that `--compress` can make  sense for text files.  But for music
# files in `~/Music`, we get a speedup factor of 1.01 with `--compress`:
#
#     sent 474.01M bytes  received 1.36K bytes  25.62M bytes/sec
#     total size is 477.96M  speedup is 1.01
#                                       ^--^
#
# Which is almost the same without:
#
#     sent 478.08M bytes  received 1.36K bytes  136.60M bytes/sec
#     total size is 477.96M  speedup is 1.00
#                                       ^--^
#
# There is virtually  no gain in using `--compress`.  On  the contrary, it makes
# the operation much  slower because audio files take much  more space than text
# files:
#
#     # with `--compress`
#     Executed in   17.63 secs    fish           external
#        usr time   20.43 secs  819.00 micros   20.43 secs
#                                               ^---^

#     # without `--compress`

#}}}
# `--copy-links`: resolve symlinks{{{
#
# That is, copy the target of a symlink, rather than the symlink itself.
#
# But  usually,  we  want  to  back   up  the  symlink,  not  its  target.   For
# example,  ATM, we  want  to  back up  the  symlinks  in `~/.vim/doc/`.   Also,
# `~/.config/nnn/bookmarks/`   might  contain   symlinks   to  potentially   big
# directories which we have no interest in backing up.  For example:
