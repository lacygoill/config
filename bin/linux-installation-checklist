  #
  #    - execute your `kbdrate(8)` command *outside tmux*
  #      (inside, the command would not work as expected)
  #
  #    - open 2 terminals

  #
  #    - after 10 seconds, press `C-X C-E` to read the command-line in a Vim buffer
  #    - in Vim, press `$` to jump at the end of the line, and look at the column
  #      index in the status line: it's the number of keypresses the console
  #      received in 10 seconds

# What is a bare Git repo?{{{
#
# When you init or clone a repo, you end up with 2 things:
# a workspace and a `.git/` directory.
#
# A bare  repo has  no workspace  and no `.git/`  directory; instead,  it just
# contains all the Git files (`.git/*`), directly at the top level.
#
#     $ mkdir /tmp/test
#     $ cd /tmp/test || exit
#
#     $ git init
#     Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/
#
#     $ ls -l .git
#     ... branches/
#     ... config
#     ... description
#     ... HEAD
#     ... hooks/
#     ... info/
#     ... objects/
#     ... refs/
#
#     $ rm -rf .*
#
#                v----v
#     $ git init --bare
#     $ ls -l
#     ... branches/
#     ... config
#     ... description
#     ... HEAD
#     ... hooks/
#     ... info/
#     ... objects/
#     ... refs/
#
# Notice that  the output  of `ls(1)` is  the same in  the 2  experiments, but
# with  `$ git init`, the  files/directories  are hidden  under `.git/`;  with
# `$ git init --bare`, they are not hidden, they are at the top level.
#}}}
# How is that useful?{{{
#
# Its purpose is to  *serve* files.  Not to *work* on them.   There is no need
# for a workspace when you serve files.
#
# Suppose you have a project in `/tmp/project/`:
#
#     $ mkdir /tmp/project
#     $ cd /tmp/project || exit
#     $ git init
#     $ touch file
#     $ git add file
#     $ git commit --message='first commit'
#
# And suppose you don't  want to host your project on GitHub,  but on your own
# server.  First, create a copy of your project as a bare repo:
#
#     $ mkdir /tmp/bare_repo
#     $ cd /tmp/bare_repo || exit
#     $ cp ../project/.git/* .
#     $ git config --type=bool core.bare true
#
# Then, upload your  bare repo to your  server.  Now, anybody who  has access to
# your server can clone the repo via `$ git clone`.
#
# To test this, delete your project:
#
#     $ cd /tmp || exit
#     $ rm -rf project
#
# And clone it back from the bare repo:
#
#     $ git clone bare_repo project
#     $ ls -l project
#     ... file
#
# Notice that it contains the previously  committed `file`.  Also, note that –
# for simplicity's sake – we didn't actually  upload the bare repo to a remote
# server.  But you can pretend that your machine is the server.
#}}}
# But here, how is that useful for us?{{{
#
# With a non-bare repo, the Git files are put under `.git/`.
# With a bare repo, you can control where the Git files are put:
#
#     $ mkdir /path/to/dir
#     $ cd /path/to/dir
#     $ git init --bare
#
#     OR
#
#     $ git init --bare /path/to/dir/
#
# Here, we leverage this  feature to put the Git files  under `.cfg/` instead of
# `.git/`.  See  our comment in this  script about `GIT_CFG_DIR` for  why that's
# useful.
#
# Basically,  it gives  us the  guarantee  that an  accidental `git(1)`  command
# doesn't mess up our  config repo.  Indeed, the latter can  only be altered via
# `--git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/` and `--work-tree=$HOME`.  The former option suppresses
# this error:
#
#     fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
#
# The latter option suppresses this error:
#
#     fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree
#}}}

  # The   function   sometimes   deals    with   paths   relative   to   `$HOME`
  # (`git-ls-files(1)`, `$CFG_PERMISSIONS`).  So, better be in it.
