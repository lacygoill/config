# This script is automatically started via:
# `~/.config/autostart/user-session.desktop`
#
# This means that it only runs when you log in graphically; not in a console.

# Sometimes, when I log back in, `vim-persistent-clipboard.service` is temporarily failed!{{{
#
# Right.  That happens if you copy some text in the clipboard from Vim, `:quit`,
# log out, then log back in:
#
#     $ systemctl --user --state=failed
#       UNIT             LOAD   ACTIVE SUB    DESCRIPTION
#     ● vim-persistent-clipboard.service loaded failed failed Make clipboard persist after quitting/suspending Vim
#
# That's because an  `xsel(1x)` process was running when you  logged out, and it
# lost  its connection  to the  X server.   Just copy  yet another  text in  the
# clipboard from Vim.  Or manually reset the failed state of the service:
#
#     $ systemctl --user reset-failed vim-persistent-clipboard.service
#
# You could also run `reset-failed` here, without arguments, to reset the failed
# state of  all units.   But it  seems wrong.  A  unit might  have failed  for a
# different reason  than a process losing  its connection to the  X server.  For
# such a unit, there is no guarantee that  it will work again after you log back
# in.

# What happens the first time we start the system?{{{
#
# In that  case, `user-session.target` cannot  be active right now.   Because it
# can only be  started manually.  And the  only place where we start  it is from
# this script.  This means that our test works as expected; it won't be true the
# first time we start the system.

# To be able to reliably `start` the target, we need to stop it first.{{{
#
# If `foo.target` is already active, `start foo.target` will not re-start all of
# `foo`'s services; only the ones which are not already running.  That's because
# `start foo.service` does not re-start `foo.service` if it's already running.
#
# But we  want *all* our  services to be re-started,  because we don't  have the
# guarantee that  their processes are  still working as expected.   For example,
# suppose we log out then log in  back: the `redshift` service is still running,
# but  its process  is no  longer setting  the color  temperature of  the screen
# (probably because it was temporarily disconnected from the display server).
#
# Besides, it  seems good practice to  first stop the target  before starting it
# again; if only to start from a known state (and avoid weird issues later).
#}}}
# And to  be even more  reliable, let's first reload  the manager in  case we've
# modified one of our unit file in-between 2 logins.

# For example,  ATM, each  time we log  out /  log back in,  we have  one more
# closing session because of a lingering `agent` process; it's a known bug:
