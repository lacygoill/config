# How to update the patches for a newer version of st?{{{
### How to undo them?

#                        new version
#                        v---v
#     $ git reset --hard X.Y.Z \
#         && git ls-files --others --directory --exclude-standard | xargs rm -f
#
# Apply just the first patch.
# If it succeeds, run:
#
#     $ git add . \
#           && git commit -m 'so far so good' \
#           && make clean \
#           && make
#
# It the code compiles, apply the second patch, and repeat the process.
#
# If  a patch  fails  to be  applied,  run  `$ vim *.rej` and  try  to apply  it
# manually.  Then:
#
#     $ git add . \
#         && git diff --staged --no-color
#
# ... to get the fixed patch; use the output to replace the old broken patch.
# Commit, compile, and continue until all patches apply successfully.
