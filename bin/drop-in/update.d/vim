# For example, that's how you can find the `libxt-dev` dependency package.
# Without, you don't have the GUI (nor the clipboard and some other features).
# In that case, if  you look at the output of the  `configure` script, the first
# interesting line matching the pattern `\.\.\. no$` is:
#
#     checking if X11 header files can be found... no
#
# And the first interesting line matching `\<support\>` comes right afterward:
#
#     checking --enable-gui argument... no GUI support
#
# These lines – and much more – are logged in `src/auto/config.log`.
# In that log file, an error is given a little before:
#
#     conftest.c:37:10: fatal error: X11/Intrinsic.h: No such file or directory
#                                    ^-------------^
#
# That missing file is the reason you need to install the `libxt-dev` package:
#
#     $ apt-file search X11/Intrinsic.h
#     libxt-dev: /usr/include/X11/Intrinsic.h
#     ^-------^

# To enable the Lua interface, you need some configuration options and Debian packages.{{{

# Options:
#
#    - `--enable-luainterp=dynamic`
#    - `--with-luajit`
#
# `--with-luajit` doesn't make `--enable-luainterp` useless.
#
# Without `--enable-luainterp`, the lua interface is not enabled.
# You can check it's working with:
#
#     :lua print(_VERSION)
#
# And that LuaJIT is available with:
#
#     :lua print(jit.version)

# See `:help :lua /luajit`.

# Packages:
#
#    - `dpkg-dev`
#    - `libluajit-5.1-dev`
#    - `luajit`
#
# Without `dpkg-dev`, the compilation would fail because of:
# `--enable-luainterp=dynamic --enable-fail-if-missing`
#
# The `configure` script would try to run this command:
#
#     $ dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH 2> /dev/null
#
# And  `dpkg-architecture(1)`  is  provided  by  `dpkg-dev`.  `configure`  needs
# the   command  to   succeed  in   order  to   later  find   `liblua5.1.so`  in
# `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`.  Otherwise, it only looks in `/usr/lib{,64}`.
#
# `libluajit-5.1-dev` and `luajit` are necessary for `--with-luajit`.
#}}}
#   Why don't you enable it?{{{
#
# I  don't   want  to  lose  time   debugging  a  failing  compilation   for  an
# interface  that   we  never  use.    For  example,  patch  9.0.1719   broke  a
# compilation  enabling the  Lua interface;  it was  fixed in  a subsequent  PR:
# https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/12811, but the point still stands.
