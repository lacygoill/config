# Do *not* use `unclutter` instead of `xbanish`.{{{
#
# `unclutter`  interferes with  the `interSubs`  script which  lets us  read the
# translation of subtitles.
#
# Besides, it could cause other issues:

#
# And finally:
#
# >     ... the unclutter source code is terrible, so I wrote xbanish.
#
# And indeed the source code of `xbanish` is shorter.
# Use `$ apt source` to get the source code of `unclutter`.
