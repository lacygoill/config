# Purpose: Get the query string (`query`) and the cursor position (`curpos`) for
# all our scripts which implement a readline key binding.
#
# Unfortunately,  `fzf(1)` doesn't  provide any  primitive  to get  nor set  the
# cursor position on  the command-line (you can only set  the cursor position in
# the list  of matches via  `pos()`).  Instead, we have  to use tmux  formats to
# compute the  cursor position; and  later, we'll use `$ tmux send-keys`  to set
# the new cursor position.

# All our scripts  expect the query string as first  argument (passed as `{q}`),
# when you call them from your `fzf(1)` key `--bind`ings.

# We need tmux to infer the cursor position on `fzf(1)`'s command-line.
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]]; then
  # We can't preserve  the cursor position (it will unconditionally  jump at the
  # end of the  command-line).  But we can at least  preserve the existing query
  # string.
  echo "$query"
