This file prevents the following lines from being printed when we log in on TTY1:

    Linux debian 6.1.0-10-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.37-1 (2023-07-03) x86_64

    The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;

The lines in the middle (between the kernel version and the last login) come
from `/etc/motd`.

We don't want noise between the kernel messages (given during the boot process)
and the first shell prompt.

For more info: `man login /FILES/;/.hushlogin`

This file also suppresses some messages when we log into a machine with SSH.
See: `man 8 sshd /FILES/;/.hushlogin`
