What are syscalls?
What is user-mode?
What is kernel-mode?

syscalls are an interface between kernel-mode and user-mode.
From `man syscalls(2)`:

   > The system call is the fundamental interface between an application and
   > the Linux kernel.

   > System calls are generally not invoked directly, but rather via wrapper
   > functions in glibc [...]

   > Often the glibc wrapper function is quite thin, doing little work other
   > than copying arguments to the right registers before invoking the system
   > call, [...]
