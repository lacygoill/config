# What does an address point to?  A bit or a byte?

A byte.

# What's the main difference between a variable in C and in assembly?

In C, a variable holds a value.
In assembly, the corresponding variable holds the *address* of that value.

That's  why  – in  assembly  code  –  you  usually (always?)  see  variables
surrounded by brackets.
