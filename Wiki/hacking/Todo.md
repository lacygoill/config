# Read these books

There aren't many good books.

Most of them seem superficial: they teach you how to use a bunch of tools, which
will probably become obsolete in a few years (if they aren't already).

The few good books I  found are also a bit old, so not sure  how easy it will be
to follow along the exercises.

Check out this link for possibly more books:

## Hacking: The Art of Exploitation

## Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking

<https://nostarch.com/pentesting>

By the time you start reading this book, a newer edition *might* have been published.

## What about those?
