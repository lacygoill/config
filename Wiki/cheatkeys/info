clear and redraw screen                 «C-l»

pipe node's contents to editor          E
# Warning: After you quit  your editor, and/or `info(1)`, the  screen might need
# to be redrawn.  Just press `C-l`.

# Tip: The mode line contains useful information to bring you back where you are.{{{
#
# For example:
#
#     $ info find
#     # press 't'
#     # press 'Tab' until the cursor is on "Common Tasks"
#     # press Enter on the hypertext link
#     # The mode line contains:
#     -----Info: (find)Common Tasks, 18 lines --Top---
#                 ^^^  ^----------^
#                file      node
#
# From the shell, you can visit this node directly with:
#
#     $ info '(find)Common Tasks'
#
# Or with:
#
#     $ info --node='Common Tasks' find
#     $ info --file='find' --node='Common Tasks'
#}}}
# Tip: After executing `info(1)`, take the habit of pressing `u`.{{{
#
# To possibly find out related documents.
#
# For example:
#
#     $ info find
#     # press 'u' to select 'Up' node: nothing interesting, but still relevant to find(1)
#     # press 'u' again: *very* interesting hypertext links at the bottom:
#     * Common Tasks::                Solutions to common real-world problems.
#     * Worked Examples::             Examples demonstrating more complex points.
#
# Once you find an  interesting hypertext link, press Enter on  it, and copy the
# `(file)node`  in the  mode  line.   Then, quit  `info(1)`,  and  pass it  back
# `(file)node` on the shell's command-line, redirecting STDOUT to an editor or a
# file.  The redirection  will make `info(1)` output the whole  node (instead of
# just a menu of its sections).
