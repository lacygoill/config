Annex {{{1
«SysRq» {{{2

# It should be the same key as the one printing the screen.
# But on some keyboards, it might be elsewhere:
# https://askubuntu.com/a/240691/867754

# Some keyboards cannot handle  so many keys being pressed at  the same time, so
# you might have better luck with:
#
#    - press `Alt`
#    - press `SysRq`
#    - release `SysRq`
#    - press <command key>
#    - release everything

# `SysRq` stands for "System Request".

«M-SysRq» {{{2

# Chord prefix to press to invoke a kernel function.

# This makes you enter  a special mode, in which you  can send commands directly
# to  the Linux  kernel, by  pressing a  command key.   The kernel  will respond
# immediately, unless it's completely locked.

# Several functions can be invoked successively  to restore the system to a safe
# state, or to obtain a clean reboot when nothing else works.

Command key {{{2

# Key suffix which needs to be pressed after «M-SysRq».

# For some command keys, you might need to press `AltGr` instead of `Alt`.

# When pressing the  command key, the layout  is set to `us`.  So,  on an azerty
# keyboard, to execute the `m` command key, you must actually press the `,` key.
