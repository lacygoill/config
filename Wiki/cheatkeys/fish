# If the  command-line is  not commented,  `#` is prefixed,  and the  command is
# executed to be logged in the history.
#
# If the  command-line *is* commented,  `#` is removed,  but the command  is not
# executed, so that you can edit it further.
#
# If the  command-line is  empty, it's set  with the most  recent one  which was
# commented out in the history; but this time, it's uncommented.
