start in rescue mode                    «Esc»
                                        boot: rescue
# This assumes that you start from a netinst CD or live install image. {{{
#
# It doesn't  work at  your usual  GRUB menu  (the one  installed on  your SSD).
# Also, Escape needs to  be pressed at the *main* installer  menu (in a submenu,
# Escape is equivalent to selecting "back").
#
# ---
#
# Once you're  in rescue  mode, answer  the questions to  set up  your language,
# country, locale,  keyboard layout,  and network.  At  the "Enter  rescue mode"
# step, select  the device to  use as root  filesystem (typically that  would be
# `/dev/sda1`).  Then, choose "Execute a  shell in /dev/...".  Once you've fixed
# your system, press `CTRL-D`, and select "Reboot the system".
#
# ---
#
# You could also  start in rescue mode  from the menu, but  the entry's location
# depends on the type of image you're  booting from.  From the menu of a netinst
# CD image:
#
#     Advanced options
#     > Rescue mode
#
# From the menu of a live install image:
#
#     Advanced install options
#     > Text installer
#     > Rescue mode
#
# Or, you  can select an  entry which installs the  system (any such  entry will
# do),  and press  Tab.  Then,  before `---`,  insert `rescue/enable=true`,  and
# press Enter.
#
# ----
#
# From the `boot:` prompt, I can't get back to the menu!
#
# There's no direct way to get back  to the installer menu (executing the `menu`
# command *might* work in some cases, e.g. if you've booted from a Grml ISO).
#
# In addition to `rescue`, other commands might be available:
#
#    - `install` (select "Abort installation" to reboot the machine)
#    - `expert` (expert install)
#    - `hdt` (aka Hardware Detection Tool); from there, you can reboot by
#      pressing `r` for "Reboot", then Enter
#
# Note that  `hdt` is not  available in the  netinst CD image  (it is in  a live
# install image).
#}}}
# You can also start in recovery/rescue mode from your usual GRUB menu.{{{
#
# Select "Advanced options  for Debian GNU/Linux", then a  kernel version ending
# with "(recovery mode)".
#
# But this assumes that  GRUB itself is not broken, and there  is still at least
# one kernel to boot from.  If that's not  the case, start in rescue mode from a
# Debian installer.
#
# ---
#
# Don't be confused by the terminology.  At the GRUB menu, it's called "recovery
# mode".  But later, when the system starts, the messages call it "rescue mode".
# These terms refer to the same thing.
#}}}
# I get an error!  "Cannot open access to console, the root account is locked."{{{
#
# This means  that you didn't  provide a password  for root when  installing the
# system.
#
# Boot  from  a  netinst CD  or  live  install  image  (they don't  require  any
# password).  If you don't  have a USB drive with one of  these images, try this
# workaround:
#
#    - at the GRUB menu, press `e` to access its config
#    - find the line starting with `linux /boot/vmlinuz-...`
#    - append `rw init=/bin/bash` on that line (*)
#    - press `CTRL-X`
#    - execute `$ passwd root` to give a password to the root account
#    - reboot with `$ reboot --force`
#
# Once you no longer need the root account, you can re-lock it:
#
#     $ sudo passwd --lock root
#
# (*) Alternatively, append `systemd.debug-shell=1`.
# This will give you a root shell accessible by pressing `CTRL-ALT-F9`.
#
# ---
#
# Beware: That  workaround  does   not  start  in  rescue   mode.   Neither  the
# keyboard  layout (QWERTY  by default),  nor the  network are  configured.  You
# might  manually  configure  the  keyboard   layout  to  AZERTY,  by  executing
# `$ loadkeys fr`.
