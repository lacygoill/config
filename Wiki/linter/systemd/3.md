Msg: Use curly brackets around an environment variable used as part of a word.

# Bad:

    ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p $FOO/dir
                                   ^--^

# Good:

    ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p ${FOO}/dir
                                    ^   ^

# Rationale: `$FOO` is only valid as a *separate* word:

   > Basic environment variable substitution is supported. **Use "${FOO}" as**
   > **part of a word**, or as a word of its own, on the command line, in which
   > case it will be replaced by the value of the environment variable
   > including all whitespace it contains, resulting in a single argument.

Source: `man 5 systemd.service /COMMAND LINES/;/FOO`

Note that `$FOO` is OK inside `sh -c '...'`:

    ExecStart=/usr/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/xsel --input --clipboard < $TMPDIR/vim/clipboard'
                                                                  ^-----^
                                                                     âœ”

Because it's  parsed by a  shell, and not  by systemd.  Nevertheless,  it's more
consistent  to use  brackets all  the  time.  It's  also more  reliable: if  you
refactor the command and drop `sh(1)`, the brackets would then become required.
