Msg: Surround `;` with spaces in an `Exec*` directive.

# Bad:

    ExecStartPre=echo one; echo two
                         ^

# Good:

    ExecStartPre=echo one ; echo two
                          ^

# Rationale:

**Most** `Exec*`  directives support  `;` to separate  commands (**!**),  but it
needs to be surrounded by whitespace.   Otherwise, `;` might be consumed as part
of the argument of a previous command.  MRE:
```systemd
[Service]
ExecStartPre=echo one; echo two
 #                   ^
ExecStart=echo -n
StandardOutput=append:/tmp/out
```
Expected: `/tmp/out` contains 2 lines: `one` and `two`.
Actual: `/tmp/out` contains 1 line: `one; echo two`.

For more info: `man 5 systemd.service /COMMAND LINES`.

(**!**)  **Except** `ExecStart`, unless `Type`  is `oneshot` (i.e. `ExecStart` +
`Type=oneshot` supports `;`, but not `ExecStart` + `Type=simple`).

No need  to lint that issue  though.  If you try  to start such a  unit, systemd
will complain:

    Failed to start [...]: Unit [...] has a bad unit file setting.
    See user logs and 'systemctl --user status [...]' for details.

And the unit's status will reveal the cause of the issue:

    $ systemctl --user status [...]
    [...]: Service has more than one ExecStart= setting, which is only allowed for Type=oneshot services. Refusing.

---

Note that – inside `sh -c '...'` –  a semicolon used to separate commands is
OK without  spaces around, but it's  more consistent to always  surround it with
spaces.  It's also more reliable: if  you refactor the command and drop `sh(1)`,
the spaces would then become required.

# Regex:

    ^\s*Exec\w*=.*\%(\S;\|;\S\)
