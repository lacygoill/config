Msg: Use `sh(1)`'s `kill` builtin syntax.

# Bad:

    ExecStop=/usr/bin/kill --signal=STOP $MAINPID
                           ^-----------^

# Good:

    ExecStop=/usr/bin/kill -STOP $MAINPID
                           ^---^

# Rationale: It's more consistent with `sh(1)`'s `kill`.  It's also more reliable:
if you  refactor the command and  use `sh(1)`'s `kill`, `--signal`  would become
invalid.  Besides, if you get an unexpected usage message from `kill(1)`:

    kill[...]: Usage:
    kill[...]:  kill [options] <pid> [...]
    [...]

You might wonder  whether the issue comes from `--signal`,  and lose time trying
other syntaxes, while the real issue is that `MAINPID` is not set.

---

For the same reason, avoid the `SIG` prefix (e.g. in `-s SIGSTOP` or `-SIGSTOP`).

---

Note  that  `killall` is  not  a  builtin in  `sh(1)`,  and  it always  supports
`--signal`.  Nevertheless, be consistent; always use the `-spec` syntax instead.

# Regex:

    \<kill\%(all\)\=\>\s\+\zs\%(--signal\>\|-s\s\+SIG\|-SIG\)
