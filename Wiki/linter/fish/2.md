Msg: `printf` does not handle `--` like in bash.

# Bad:

    printf -- '%s\n' $var
           ^^

# Good:

    printf '%s\n' $var

# Rationale:

   > It doesn't support any options, so there is no need for a -- separator,
   > which makes it easier to use for arbitrary input than echo.

Source: `man printf`

# Regex:

    \C\<printf\s\+\zs--\s\+
