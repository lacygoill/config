Msg: Quote a variable expansion in a test.

# Bad:

    test $var = 'value'

# Good:

    test "$var" = 'value'
         ^    ^

# Rationale: Without, you might get unexpected errors:
```fish
test $var = 'value'
```
    test: Missing argument at index 3
```fish
test "$var" = 'value'
```
    no error
    (but the test failed, and the exit status is 1)

Or unexpected results:
```fish
test -n $var
echo $status
```
    0
```fish
test -n "$var"
echo $status
```
    1

The issue  comes from  the fact  that `var`  might not  be set  (or set  with no
value), in which case its expansion is  nothing.  While in theory, this issue is
not specific to `test(1)`, in practice,  it probably occurs more frequently in a
`test(1)` command, because testing a variable implies an uncertainty with regard
to its existence or to its value.

Besides, this is the recommended practice:

   > Since it is  always safe to enclose variables in  double-quotes when used as
   > test arguments that is the recommended practice.
