Msg: Escape dollar anchor in double-quoted regex.

# Bad:

    echo "xxx($|\s)"
              ^

# Good:
              vv
    echo "xxx(\$|\s)"
              ^^

# Rationale:

In a  double-quoted string, an  unescaped `$`  is unconditionally parsed  as the
start of  a variable  reference.  And the  name of a  variable can  only contain
letters, digits, and underscores:

   > A variable name can contain only letters, digits, and underscores.

Source: `man fish-language /SHELL VARIABLES`

This parsing can break a `$` anchor in a regex.

Note that there is obviously no issue in a single-quoted regex:

    echo 'xxx($|\s)'
         ^         ^
