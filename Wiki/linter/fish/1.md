There are some cases where quotes can be omitted.  For example here:

    if test $(count $var) = 1

That's because `count(1)` always outputs something,  even if it's not passed any
argument:

    $ count
    0

But that's a special case.  Be consistent  with the general case, and always use
quotes.
