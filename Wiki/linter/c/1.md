Msg: % 2 == 1 might give UB.

# Bad:

    if (num % 2 == 1)

# Good:

    if (num % 2 != 0)

# Rationale:

`if (num % 2 == 1)` is only reliable if you have the guarantee that `num / 2` is
rounded down.  If  it's rounded toward 0, and `num`  is negative, then `num % 2`
is `-1`, not `1`.

# Regex:

    % 2 == 1[^0-9]
