Msg: Do not declare a global variable from a function.

# Bad:

    function foo {
      declare -g var='val'
      ^------------------^
      ...
    }

# Good:

    declare var='val'
    ^---------------^
    function foo {
      ...
    }

# Rationale: Declaring a global variable from a function is confusing.

You should declare it at the script level.

Besides, if  you declare a  global variable from  a function, you  might wrongly
think that `declare -g` can always let you override dynamic scoping.  It cannot:

    var='global'

    function A {
      local var='local'
      B
    }

    function B {
      declare -g var
      echo "$var"
    }

    A

The previous code outputs `local`, even though `var` was declared as global.

Actually, `declare -g` can  override dynamic scoping, but only  when writing the
variable  (assignment),  not  when  reading  it.   So,  in  the  previous  code,
`declare -g var='some value'` would have worked as expected.
