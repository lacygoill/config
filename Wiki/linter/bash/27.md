Msg: Prefer `date(1)` over `stat(1)` to get time of last file modification.

# Bad:

    stat --format='%Y' file

# Good:

    date --reference=file +'%s'

# Rationale: `date(1)` is faster; (at least  on our machine).

Probably because  it just has one  information to retrieve, while  `stat(1)` has
several (e.g. 3 timestamps, size, permissions, ...). It's also more readable.

Warning: You can only call `date(1)` to get the time of last *modification*; not
the time  of last *status change*.  For  the latter, you need  to call `stat(1)`
with the format sequence `%z` or `%Z`.

# Regex:

    \<stat\>\s.*%y
