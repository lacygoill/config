Msg: For `sort(1)` to output unique lines, use the `C` locale.

# Bad:

    cmd | sort --unique

# Good:

    cmd | LC_ALL=C sort --unique
          ^------^

# Rationale: `$ sort --unique` doesn't compare whether strings are identical.

But  whether they  sort the  same.  So  if you  do want  unique lines,  you need
a  locale  where  a character  is  a  byte  and  all characters  have  different
sorting order (which  the `C` locale guarantees).  Otherwise,  the command might
unexpectedly filter out a unique line because it sorted the same as another.

# Regex:

    \%(LC_ALL=C\)\@8<!\%(^\|\s\)sort\s.*\%(-u\>\|--unique\>\)
