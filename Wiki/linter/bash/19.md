Msg: In a `find(1)` command, `-prune` does nothing when `-depth` is in effect.

# Bad:

    find . -depth -name DIR -prune -o -delete
                            ^-------^ ^-----^

# Good:

    find . -depth \! \( -path '*/DIR/*' -o -path '*/DIR' \) -delete
                  ^---------------------------------------^ ^-----^

# Rationale:

`-delete`  turns on  `-depth` which  causes  `find(1)` to  traverse the  current
directory depth-first (i.e.  starting with the deepest nodes).  So,  by the time
`find(1)` processes `DIR`, it's too late  to effectively prune its contents; the
latter has already been processed anyway.

# Regex:

    \<find\s\%(.*\s\zs-prune\>\)\@=\%(.*\s-delete\>\)\@=
