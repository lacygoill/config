Msg: C-style for loop or brace expansion is more efficient/readable.

# Bad:

    for i in $(seq 1 10)

# Good:

    for ((i = 1; i <= 10; i++))

# Rationale: The latter is more efficient and probably more readable.

You can also use a brace expansion:

    for i in {1..10}

But this syntax is more limited (see our Vim bash snippet for more info).

# Regex:

    \<for\s\+\i\+\s\+in\s\+\zs$(seq\s\+[^.]*)
