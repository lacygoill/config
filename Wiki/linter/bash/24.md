Msg: In a regex pattern, prefer `[[:blank:]]` over `\ `.

# Bad:

    [[ "$var" =~ a\ b ]]
                  ^^

# Good:

    [[ "$var" =~ a[[:blank:]]b ]]
                  ^---------^

# Rationale: `[[:blank:]]` can match a space *and* a tab.

Which is more likely to be what you want.  Besides, `\ ` makes it harder to spot
where the operand  ends.  Note that if  you want to match  more characters which
have no glyphs, try `[[:space:]]`.

# Regex:

    \[\[\s.*\s=\~\s.*\zs\\\s
