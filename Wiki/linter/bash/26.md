Msg: Prefer `((` over `[[` for arithmetic comparisons.

# Bad:

    [[ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]]
    [[ $X*10 -le $Y/5 ]]

# Good:

    (( EUID != 0 ))
    (( X * 10 <= Y / 5 ))

# Rationale: C/Python-like comparison operators inside `((` are more readable.

Besides, `((`  gives you  more freedom  with regard to  spacing.  That  is, with
`[[`, spaces inside an operand need to be quoted:

    [[ "$X * 10" -le "$Y / 5" ]]
       ^       ^     ^      ^

# Regex:

    \[\[.*-\%(eq\|ne\|lt\|le\|gt\|ge\)\>
