Msg: Declare a variable as an integer whenever possible.

# Bad:

    declare n=123

# Good:

    declare -i n=123
            ^^

# Rationale: It makes the code more meaningful.

Note that it also  lets you do arithmetic without `((` and  without `$` in front
of a variable name.
```bash
declare -i SUM
X=1
Y=2
SUM=X+Y
echo "$SUM"
```
    3

That said, prefer `((`  to do arithmetic; it's more reliable.   If you forget to
declare  `SUM` as  an  integer, `X+Y`  won't  give any  error  message; just  an
unwanted result:
```bash
declare SUM
X=1
Y=2
SUM=X+Y
echo "$SUM"
```
    X+Y
```bash
declare SUM
X=1
Y=2
SUM=$X+$Y
echo "$SUM"
```
    1+2

And it's  too easy  to mix  variable names, some  of which  might not  have been
declared as  integers.  Putting  the expression inside  `((` guarantees  that it
will remain an arithmetic evaluation.

We don't give any warning for an *un*declared variable:

    n=123

In  practice, it  would sometimes  give false  positives (i.e.  the variable  is
merely reset, but was already declared as an integer in a previous command).

# Regex:
```vim
    # the variable must be declared (possibly with some attribute, except the integer one)
    '\%(^\s*\%(declare\|local\|readonly\)\>[-aAr[:blank:]]\+\)\@<='
    # we're looking for an assigned variable
    .. '\<\i\+\ze='
    # init with an integer
    .. '-\=\d\+$'
```
