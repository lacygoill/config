Msg: In a `find(1)` command, prefer `-delete` over `rm(1)`.

# Bad:
                     v--------------------------v
    find . -name PAT -exec /usr/bin/rm -f '{}' \+
    find . -name PAT -print0 | xargs --null rm -f
                             ^------------------^

# Good:

    find . -depth -name PAT -delete
           ^----^           ^-----^

# Rationale: `-delete` is simpler to read and maintain.

It's also  more efficient because it  entirely avoids the overhead  of forking a
new process and calling `execve(2)` to  run `/usr/bin/rm`.  The file deletion is
performed from the directory containing the  entry to be deleted, so it provides
the same security advantages as `-execdir`.

Warning: `-delete` comes with a few caveats (look for "-delete" in our "find" Wiki).

# Regex:

    \<find\s.*\%(\s-exec\%(dir\)\=\s\zsrm\||\s*xargs\s.*\s\zsrm\)\s\@=
