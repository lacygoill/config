Msg: Cannot declare and init a read-only variable in different commands.

# Bad:

    readonly VAR
    VAR=value

# Good:

    readonly VAR=value

# Regex:
```vim
    '\<\%('
    # a read-only variable can be declared with `readonly` (possibly with some attribute)
    .. 'readonly\%(\s\+-[aA]\)\='
    # or with `declare`/`local` and the readonly attribute (`-r`); and possibly other attributes
    .. '\|' .. '\%(declare\|local\)\>\%([-aAi[:blank:]]\+-r\>\)\@='
    # in the previous group, attributes were zero-width; now, we need to include them in the match
    .. '\)[-aAir[:blank:]]\+'
    # we're looking for a variable name with no initializer
    .. '\<\i\+$'
```
