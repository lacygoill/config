Msg: Don't hard-code temporary directory to avoid race condition.

# Bad:

    cd /tmp || exit

# Good:

    tmp_dir="$(mktemp --directory)"
    cd "$tmp_dir" || exit

# Rationale: The second version is more reliable.

Suppose your script A needs to write some  data into a new file `foo` to read it
later, but at  execution time, another script B deletes  `/tmp/foo` before A had
the  time to  read it.   Your script  won't work  as expected.   This is  a race
condition.

# Regex:

    \<cd\s\+/tmp\%(/\S*\)\=\s*||\s*\%(exit\|return\)\>
