Msg: In a `find(1)` command, `-exec ... \;` is insecure and inefficient.

# Bad:

    find . -exec CMD '{}' \;
           ^---^          ^^

# Good:

           v---v          vv
    find . -exec CMD '{}' \+
    find . -execdir CMD '{}' \;
    find . -execdir CMD '{}' \+
           ^------^          ^^

# Rationale: `-execdir` is more secure than `-exec`.

The latter  only makes sense  if you care more  about performance.  But  in that
case,  you need  to terminate  the command  with `\+`  instead of  `\;` to  pass
multiple files to a single process.

NOTE: `-execdir ... \+` is secure and more efficient than `-execdir ... \;`, but
not as  efficient as  `-exec ... \+`. Even though the  former can  pass multiple
files to  `CMD`, they need  to be in the  same directory.  This  requirement can
cause `-execdir ... \+` to start many more processes than `-exec ... \+`.

# Regex:

    \<find\s.*\s-\%(exec\|ok\)\s.*\zs\\;
