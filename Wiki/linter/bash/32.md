Msg: Surround an associative array's key with quotes.

# Bad:

    associative_array[some key]='value'
                      ^      ^

# Good:

    associative_array['some key']='value'
                      ^        ^

# Rationale: Quotes make the code more meaningful.

Without them, you  might wonder how the  key is interpreted: it's  parsed like a
(double-quoted) string.   For example,  `1 + 2` is not  evaluated into  `3`, but
`$var` is dereferenced.

# Regex:

    \[['"]\@![^]]*\w\@1<= \w\@=[^]]*\]=
