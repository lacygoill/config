Msg: Don't start a subscript with a dollar sigil.

# Bad:

           v
    $array[$i]
    $array[$key]
           ^

# Good:

           v
    $array[i]
    $array["$key"]
           ^    ^

# Rationale:

With an associative array, we want the subscript to be quoted.

With a non-associative array, the sigil is useless, and we want to omit it to be
reminded that the subscript is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.

# Regex:

    \%(\<\%([gm]\=awk\|unset\)\>.*\)\@<!\[\zs\$[^]]*\]
