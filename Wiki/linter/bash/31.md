Msg: Prefer a named class like `[:alnum:]` over a range like `a-z`.

# Bad:

    [[ "$arg" =~ [-a-zA-Z0-9]+ ]]
                   ^-------^

# Good:

    [[ "$arg" =~ [-[:alnum:]]+ ]]
                   ^-------^

# Rationale: It's more readable and reliable.

The semantics of a range depends on the locale's collation order (`LC_COLLATE`).
For example, the locale might sort in dictionary order:

    aAbBcC...xXyYzZ

In those locales, `[a-z]` is not case-sensitive, except for `z`.

Besides, named classes can handle multibyte characters:

    $ touch a à ; echo [a-z] ; echo [[:lower:]]
    a
    a à

# Pitfall: If you need to include the `$` character inside the bracket expression, write it at the very end:

     ✘
     v
    [$[:alnum:]]
    [[:alnum:]$]
              ^
              ✔

The first expression would give an error:

    :alnum:: syntax error: operand expected (error token is ":alnum:")

More generally, `$`  might be unexpectedly interpreted as  a parameter expansion
(e.g. `$#`), which is why you want it at the very end.

# Regex:

    a-z\|0-9
