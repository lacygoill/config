Msg: In a `chown(1)`-like command, prefix a numeric ID with `+`.

# Bad:

    chown 42 file
          ^^

# Good:

    chown +42 file
          ^

# Rationale: POSIX mandates that `chown(1)` first tries to resolve `42` as a name.

Only if the resolution fails can it interpret `42` as a numeric ID.  So, suppose
you're working  on a system where  `42` is a user  name that maps to  some other
user ID (e.g. `1234`).  In that case, your command will actually run:

    chown 1234 file

That's not what you wanted.

By preceding `42` with `+`, `chown(1)` is  forced to interpret it as an integer,
because a valid user/group name cannot contain `+`.

As a  benefit, you make  `chown(1)` skip the  name look-up process,  which might
result in a significant performance improvement.
