Msg: Prefer `x is None` over `x == None`.

# Bad:

    x == None

# Good:

    x is None

# Rationale:

It's more idiomatic to use `is`/`is not`  in order to compare an expression with
`None`, rather than to use `==`/`!=`.

---

pylint already gives a message:

    C0121: Comparison 'x == None' should be 'x is None' (singleton-comparison)

But we might use a different linter in the future, which doesn't report this.

# Regex:

    [!=]=\%(\s*None\>\)\@=
