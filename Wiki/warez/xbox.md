I *think* our router is limited to 100 Mbps.  Transferring via a USB drive or an
external SSD might be much faster (typically a few minutes vs an hour or so):

Disable "Ray tracing" if the frame rate sometimes drops too much.
BTW, for a showcase of what that feature is:

In first person shooters, the frame rate is more important than graphics.
(what about other types of games?)

Don't buy games which are too recent.
In addition to being costly, they might receive DLCs later, which are bundled in
some "special" edition (e.g. definitive, deluxe, GOTY, ...).  That'll be the case
of "Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous".

---

Some games  might miss an  in-game chat feature.  For  those, it seems  the best
alternative is "xbox party chat":

# FAQ
## What's GPU?

Game Pass Ultimate

## How to share GPU with family members?

<https://support.xbox.com/fr-fr/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/xbox-game-pass-friends-family-faq>

Caveats:

   - it's not yet possible in France
   - it does not allow to share a purchased game with all family members ([steam does](https://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing))

## How to share purchased games with another person?

Both persons must create an [Xbox Live account](https://www.xbox.com/fr-fr/live), and share  their credentials (email +
password), then each of them must add the account of the other person on their console:

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Add or switch"
   - select "Add new"
   - enter the Xbox Live credentials of the other person
   - press "Next" when the privacy message pops up

Log in as the other person:

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Add or switch"
   - select the other person's account

Make the console the home Xbox of the other person:

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Settings"
   - select "General"
   - select "Personalization"
   - select "My home Xbox"
   - select "Make this my home Xbox"

Log in back as oneself:

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Add or switch"
   - select your account

Check out the full library of games and apps:

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "My games & apps"
   - select "See All"
   - select "Full Library"
   - select "All owned games" (or "Xbox Game Pass", "Games with Gold", "EA Play")

You might still need to download the game(s).

##
## How to keep games up to date?

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Settings"
   - select "System"
   - select "Updates"
   - check "Keep my console up to date" and "Keep my games & apps up to date"

<https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/settings-updates/system-update-overview>

## How to download a game while the console is sleeping?

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Settings"
   - select "Power Options"
   - select "Sleep"

Now you  can start  the download  of the game  and switch  the console  off into
Instant-on  mode.  Once  the download  is finished,  make sure  to set  back the
console to "Shutdown (energy saving)" in the last previously used menu.

## ?

Why should I power off the console?

It reduces  the electricity bill,  and prevents  memory from being  corrupted in
case of a power failure.

    https://support.xbox.com/en-IE/help/hardware-network/power/learn-about-power-modes

## How to fully power off the console?

Press and  hold the Xbox button  on the front of  the console for a  few seconds
(until the button stops flashing and the screen no longer receives any signal).

Alternatively:

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Settings"
   - select "Power Options"
   - select "Shutdown now"

## How to reset the console to factory defaults?

   - press the Xbox button to open the guide
   - select "Profile & system"
   - select "Settings"
   - select "System"
   - select "Console Info"
   - select "Reset Console"
   - select "Reset and keep my games & apps"

<https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults>

##
## What are the warning signs of an overheating console?

   - the fans making a lot of noise, which becomes persistent background noise
   - graphical glitches, frame drops, slow loading times
   - a message saying that the console is getting too warm

### How to prevent that?

   - keep it on a stable and cool surface
   - keep it away from any source of heat
   - give it 4 to 6 inches of clearance on all sides
   - don't put it in an enclosed cabinet
   - don't put it on a carpet or rug with long fibres

   - make sure the vents are not blocked
   - gently vacuum the vents to help clear any debris or dust that might have
     accumulated
   - switch to energy-saving power mode
   - reset to factory defaults

As a last resort, power off the console, and leave it off for at least an hour.
