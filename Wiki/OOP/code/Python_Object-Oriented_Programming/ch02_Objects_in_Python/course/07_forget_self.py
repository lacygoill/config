# Purpose: study what happens when we forget `self` in a method's header
# Reference: page 47 (paper) / 68 (ebook)

    # we purposefully omit `self` to see what will happen

#     TypeError: reset() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given

# We get an error which is expected.
# Although, the message could be more helpful:

#     missing self argument in method
