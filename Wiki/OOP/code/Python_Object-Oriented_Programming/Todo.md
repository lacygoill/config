While studying chapter 1, read a little more about the mermaid documentation:
<https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid>
In particular, try to reproduce as many diagrams.

Document somewhere the formula to compute a distance between 2 points A and B in
a 2-dimensional space:

$$ \sqrt{\left(x_a - x_b \right)^2 + \left(y_a - y_b \right)^2} $$

Also, document that the `hypot()` function from the `math` module can compute it:

    math.hypot(a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y)
               ^^^
               x coordinate of point A
