% Why changing the font within a `\section` command is sub-optimal?{{{
%
% The section number  is typeset with serifs, which doesn't  match the remaining
% sans-serif  heading. The better  way is  to declare  the font  of the  section
% headings ONCE for the complete document.

\section{\sffamily\LaTeX\ resources on the internet}
% Why don't we write `\rmfamily`?{{{
%
% We don't need  `\rmfamily` to restore the serif font,  because `\sffamily` was
% used inside  an argument  passed to  a command;  its scope  is limited  to the
% argument.
