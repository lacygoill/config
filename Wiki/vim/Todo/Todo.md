# Refactoring
## `&l:` → `&`

    &l:cms → &cms

There are 2 cases to consider:

   - writing an option
   - reading an option

When you write an  option, you probably want to keep  `&l:`; otherwise, you also
alter the global value which is most probably not what you want.

When you read an option, you can probably drop `l:`.
But there is one special case to consider; if you omit `l:`, the global value is
used when:

   - the option value is a string
   - the local value is an empty string
   - the option is global-local

Example:
```vim
vim9script
&l:keywordprg = ''
&g:keywordprg = 'global'
echo &keywordprg
```
    global

This is not the case for a simple local option:
```vim
vim9script
&l:cinkeys = ''
&g:cinkeys = 'global'
echo &cinkeys == ''
```
    true

Is that an issue?
Do we need `l:` when reading the value of a global-local?
I don't think so.
Usually (always?), when we read the value  of an option, we're interested in the
value which takes  effect.  In the case  of a global-local option,  if the local
value is an empty string, the global value takes effect.

## use `&` syntax instead of `:set` whenever possible

The only times where it won't be possible or too difficult is for `-=`, `+=`, `^=`.
For example, you can't use `&` to refactor this:

    set cpoptions-=aA

Also, make sure to expand `~`:

                  ✘
                  v
    &backupdir = '~/.local/share/vim/backup//'

    &backupdir = $HOME .. '/.local/share/vim/backup//'
                 ^---^
                   ✔

Otherwise, Vim will treat `~` as a literal character, and the path as relative.
IOW, instead of using this directory:

    /home/user/.local/share/vim/backup

Vim will use this one:

    /home/user/.vim/~/.local/share/vim/backup

But for some reason, this issue doesn't seem to affect `'packpath'`.
This works as expected:

    &packpath = '~/.vim'

Weird...

Edit: I think we've done it.  However, study/document this tilde expansion issue.

##
## use more functions as methods:
```vim
vim9script
var funcnames =<< trim END
    add
    charidx
    complete
    escape
    shellescape
    extendnew
    get
    index
    isdirectory
    items
    join
    keys
    match
    matchend
    remove
    split
    stridx
    string
    tolower
    values
END
@+ = '\C\%(->\)\@2<!\<\%(' .. funcnames->join('\|') ..  '\)('
echo @+
```
## finish reviewing our "deep" qfl

I think its purpose was to refactor as many `deepcopy()` + `map()` and `copy()` + `map()`
into `mapnew()` as possible.

Did we make some mistake(s)?

Remember that `mapnew()` only makes a shallow copy...

##
## When should we
### pass `W`, `c` or `z` to `search()`?

I think we definitely need to pass `c` in a while loop.
And if `search()` is passed `b`, I  think `W` should be passed too, even outside
a loop.
Otherwise, you're allowing Vim to wrap around  the end of the file, and it could
find sth *after* your current position, which may be unexpected.

I'm not sure for the rest of the time.
I  tend to  think that  `W` should  always be  passed, but  there may  be a  few
exceptions...

    \m\Csearch\%(pos\|pair\|pairpos\)\=(\%(.*W\)\@!)\@!

As for `z`, does it improve the perf?
If so, should we have passed it to `search()` and `searchpos()` all the time?

---

Now that  I think  about it,  you probably don't  want `W`  if you're  writing a
motion which you want  to wrap around the end of the file,  like the default `n`
motion when `'wrapscan'` is set.

---

Mmm.
I thought that `b`  without `W` lead to unexpected results, but  I'm not so sure
anymore.
You may want  to look for sth backward,  but if that sth can't  be found before,
you may want  to look for it  after, and so let  Vim wrap around the  end of the
file...

Although, that seems theoretical.
In practice, I think using `W` with `b` will be fine.

---

If you do sth like this:

    call cursor(1, 1)
    call search(pat)

I would recommend to use `W`:

    call search(pat, 'W')

It's not needed but it explicits what is going to happen.
Either `search()` finds `pat`,  and it doesn't wrap around the  end of the file,
or it  does not find  `pat`, and again,  it doesn't wrap  around the end  of the
file.
In both cases, it won't wrap; `W` tells us that.

---

Make sure we have not used `W` when we should not have in the past.

    \m\Csearch\%(pos\|pair\|pairpos\)\=(\%(.*W\)\@=
                                       │├─────────┘
                                       ││
                                       │└ there must be a W flag
                                       └ there must be an open parenthesis

---

I think that if you use `search()` to:

   - describe some text, you should use `W`

   - move the cursor, you should not use `W`

     With one exception: if your custom motion is a wrapper around a default motion, then
     respect its behavior.
     For example, `}` does not wrap, so if you customize it, it should still not wrap.

##
## use <cmd> whenever possible

Check whether we could remove some `norm! gv` or `gv`.

---

Try to  use `<c-\><c-n>`  in front of  `<cmd>` (in a  visual mapping)  only when
really  necessary.   You  don't  always  need it;  remember  that  you  can  use
`line('v')` and `line('.')` instead of `line("'<")` and `line("'>")`.

## Try to use `:help optional-function-argument` to reduce noise.

I.e. it can help you omit a boolean at various call sites.

# Plugins
## Write tests for matchparen

We had an issue in the past with our matchparen plugin.
Sometimes, the highlights were not removed.
For example, suppose the buffer contains this text:

    a (
    )

Press `V` to select the first line.
Press `j` to include the 2nd line inside the selection; at that point, I suspect
the parens were highlighted (although, not easy to notice).
Press `>` to increase the lines indentation.
Press `u` to undo.
The parens were wrongly highlighted.

*Maybe* the issue could also be reproduced without entering visual mode:

    G>ku

Anyway, try to write a test for this issue.
Also, write tests for all the other matchparen issues you've fixed.

Do *not* try to use `win_execute()`; it doesn't work:

    $ vim -Nu NONE +'set wmh=0|sp|call win_getid(2)->win_execute("resize 0")'

Instead:

    $ vim -Nu NONE +'set wmh=0|sp|2resize 0'
