# Startup
## What are the locations from which Vim sources files when I start it with `$ vim -Nu NORC`?

   1. `~/.vim/plugin/**/*.vim`
   2. `$VIMRUNTIME/plugin/**/*.vim`
   3. `~/.vim/pack/*/start/*/plugin/**/*.vim`
   4. `~/.vim/pack/*/start/*/after/plugin/**/*.vim`
   5. `~/.vim/after/plugin/**/*.vim`

TODO:  Shouldn't the step 3 come *before* 2?

### And if I
#### start it with `$ vim -Nu /tmp/empty_vimrc.vim`?

 1. `/tmp/empty_vimrc.vim`
 2. `~/.vim/plugin/**/*.vim`
 3. `$VIMRUNTIME/plugin/**/*.vim`
 4. `~/.vim/pack/*/start/*/plugin/**/*.vim`
 5. `~/.vim/pack/*/start/*/after/plugin/**/*.vim`
 6. `~/.vim/after/plugin/**/*.vim`

#### write `filetype plugin indent on` in the vimrc?

During the sourcing of the vimrc, and before `~/.vim/plugin/`, Vim sources:

   1. `$VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin.vim`
   2. `$VIMRUNTIME/indent.vim`
   3. `$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/{syntax,synload,syncolor}.vim`

#### write `colorscheme default` at the end of the vimrc?

During the sourcing of the  vimrc, after the filetype/indent/syntax plugins, and
before `~/.vim/plugin/`, Vim sources:

   1. `$VIMRUNTIME/colors/default.vim`

#### add `:packadd!` statements?

Right after `~/.vim/plugin/`, Vim sources the files in `~/.vim/pack/{minpac,mine}/opt/plugin/`.

And right before `~/.vim/after/plugin/`, Vim sources the files in
`~/.vim/pack/{minpac,mine}/opt/*/after/plugin/`.
Those are rare.
The only directory matching this pattern atm on my machine is
`~/.vim/pack/minpac/opt/ultisnips/after/plugin/`.

##
## If I start `$ vim --noplugin`, is `~/.vim/plugin/vim-foo/ftdetect/foo.vim` still sourced?

Yes.

## What's the effect of `--noplugin` when passed to `vim(1)`?

It prevents Vim from sourcing any script in a `plugin/` directory.
Other files/directories are unaffected.

Don't be confused by the word “plugin”.
Usually it's used to refer to a set of related files with a common purpose.
But for Vim, “plugin files” are just the files in a `plugin/` directory.

##
## How to start Vim with no script sourced?

    $ vim -Nu NONE

or

    $ vim -Nu NORC --noplugin
              │      │
              │      └ same as:  --cmd 'set noloadplugins'
              │
              └ nothing except the plugins

### With only the filetype/indent/syntax plugins?

    $ vim -Nu NONE --cmd 'filetype plugin indent on | syntax enable'
                     │
                     └ execute the command before the vimrc

This will make Vim source the scripts:

    ~/.vim/filetype.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/indent.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/{syntax,syntax,syncolor}.vim

#### my local plugins?

    $ vim -Nu NORC

This will make Vim source the plugins in:

    ~/.vim/plugin/**/*.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/**/*.vim
    ~/.vim/after/plugin/**/*.vim

#### my local plugins and the filetype/indent/syntax plugins?

    $ vim -Nu NORC --cmd 'filetype plugin indent on | syntax enable'

This will make Vim source the scripts:

    ~/.vim/filetype.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/indent.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/{syntax,synload,syncolor}.vim

    ~/.vim/plugin/**/*.vim
    $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/**/*.vim
    ~/.vim/after/plugin/**/*.vim

In effect,  you're starting Vim  with everything except the  third-party plugins
handled by your plugin manager.

Note that  you could change  the order of  these 2 blocks  by using `+`  or `-c`
instead of `--cmd`.

#### the plugin `vim-foo`?

                   v---v         v
    $ vim -Nu NORC --cmd 'set rtp^=/path/to/vim-foo rtp-=~/.vim rtp-=~/.vim/after'
                                                       │           │
                                                       │           └ disable `~/.vim/after/plugin/*.vim`
                                                       └ disable `~/.vim/plugin/*.vim`

Make sure to use `--cmd`, and not `+` or `-c`, so that the path to the plugin is
added to the rtp *before* Vim looks for plugins to source.
Otherwise, the interface of `vim-foo` won't be sourced.

Also, make sure to use `^=` instead of `+=`.

---

Note that by default, there's no way to just source one plugin.
Either you start Vim  with `-Nu NONE` and no plugin is sourced,  or you start it
with `-Nu NORC`, and all the plugins in these directories are sourced:

   - ~/.vim/plugin/
   - $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/
   - ~/.vim/after/plugin/

A guard such as:

    if stridx(&rtp, 'vim-exchange') == -1
        finish
    endif

Or:

    if !exists('g:loaded_sandwich')
        finish
    endif

can disable most plugins in `~/.vim/{after/}plugin/`.

But some  files, such  as `~/.vim/after/plugin/nop.vim`,  can't be  guarded like
this because they're not associated to any third-party plugin.
Which is why we always also use this guard:

    if exists('g:no_{after_}plugin')
        finish
    endif

##
## `:Scriptnames` tells me that some sourced files are not plugins.  Which reasons did Vim have to source them?

They've been sourced by either:

   - an autocmd

   - some interface (mapping, custom Ex command, ...)
     which triggered the sourcing of an autoloaded script

    - a filetype/syntax/indent plugin for a buffer

# Verbosity
## How to increase Vim's verbosity level during
### Vim's startup?

Use the `-V` argument:

    $ vim -V2 file

### Vim's startup AND redirect the messages in a file?

Use the `-V` argument:

    $ vim -V2/tmp/messages file
             │
             └ do NOT add a space,
               otherwise Vim will interpret `/tmp/messages` as a regular file to edit,
               instead of the file where to redirect all messages

Technically, this command sets two options:

   - &verbose = 2
   - &verbosefile = /tmp/log

### the execution of a single Ex command?

    :2 verbose Cmd

### the execution of several commands separated by bars?

`:verbose` only applies to the command up to the next bar, so this doesn't work:

    :2 verbose set verbose | set verbose
    verbose=2  ✔˜
    verbose=0  ✘˜

You muse also use `:execute`:

    :2 verbose execute 'set verbose | set verbose'
    verbose=2  ✔˜
    verbose=2  ✔˜

##
## What's the maximum verbosity level above which you shouldn't go without redirecting the messages in a file?

8.

From 9 and above, Vim displays a message for every autocmd executed.
If you  have an  autocmd listening  to `CursorMoved`,  you won't  be able  to do
anything, without being constantly interrupted by a message.

## What to do if Vim's display too many messages after increase its verbosity level?

Redirect them in a file:

    :set verbosefile=/tmp/messages

        THEN

    :set verbose={lvl}
    :cmd1
    :cmd2
    :cmd3
    ...
    :set verbose=0

        OR

    :{lvl}verbose cmd

        FINALLY

    :set verbosefile=

## What are the six things for which I can ask the last file to have changed their definition?   How to ask?

    ┌─────────────────┬───────────────────────┐
    │ augroup         │ verbose autocmd foo   │
    ├─────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
    │ command         │ verbose command Cmd   │

    └─────────────────┴───────────────────────┘

##
## Above which verbosity level does Vim display a message when:
### a file is sourced?

2

### a tags or include file is searched?

5

### the viminfo file is read/written?

1

### an exception is thrown, caught, finished, discarded?

13

### an exception or a command is suspended while a finally clause is processed?

14

### a function is executed?

12

### an Ex command is executed?

15

### an autocmd is executed?

9

### a shell command is executed (via `:!`, `:make`, `:grep`, `system[list]()`, backtick expansion ...)?

4

### a group of autocommands is executed for a file?

8

##
## What are the three type of messages for which you can read/set the last message?   How?

    ┌─────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
    │ type    │ how to read last message │ how to set last message  │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
    │ Error   │ echo v:errormsg          │ let v:errormsg = 'foo'   │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
    │ Status  │ echo v:statusmsg         │ let v:statusmsg = 'foo'  │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
    │ Warning │ echo v:warningmsg        │ let v:warningmsg = 'foo' │
    └─────────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘

## What type of message does `:verbose cmd` give?

Status.

## Does `:silent verbose cmd` prevent Vim from giving and displaying messages?

Yes:

    :silent verbose runtime foobar.vim
    no message displayed˜
    no message added in `:mess`˜

## How to react to a message given by `:verbose cmd` without displaying any message?

    let v:statusmsg = ''

    silent verbose cmd

    if v:statusmsg is# '...'
        " do sth
    endif

It works because `:silent verbose` doesn't prevent Vim from populating `v:statusmsg`.

## How to debug 'foldexpr', 'formatexpr' or 'indentexpr'?

By  default,  Vim   doesn't  give  any  error  message  when   an  error  occurs
while  evaluating an  expression  used to  set  `'foldexpr'`, `'formatexpr'`  or
`'indentexpr'`.

To change that, set `'debug'` and give it the value `msg` or `throw`:

    ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ set debug=msg   │ Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given anyway │
    ├─────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ set debug=throw │ Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given anyway │
    │                 │ and also throw an exception and set `v:errmsg`                      │
    └─────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Warning:

It seems it can also produce false errors in irrelevant files.
Use sparingly, i.e. only when really needed.

# Profiling
## general plugin
### What are the five steps necessary to profile a script/function?

   1. set the location of the profile
   2. set the scripts/functions to profile
   3. source the scripts/functions
   4. use the script / invoke the function to use the functionality you want to profile
   5. quit/restart Vim

---

Yes, you need  to source the scripts/functions unless they  haven't been sourced
yet.  I.e. you  can skip step 3  if, and only if,  the scripts/functions haven't
been sourced before `:profile`.

### How to set the location of the profile?

    :profile start /tmp/profile.log

Here, the profile will be written in `/tmp/profile.log` once we leave Vim.
If `/tmp/profile.log` already exists, it will be overwritten.

### How to set the scripts/functions to profile?

    :profile! file {pat}
    :profile  func {pat}

### Does `:profile file */foo.vim` profile ALL commands in the matching files?

No.

Only the ones outside functions.

If you want to include the commands inside functions, you must use a bang:

    :profile! file */foo.vim
            ^

TODO: To get as much info as possible, you might also need to temporarily remove
an anti-reinclusion guard.  Make further tests and better document this pitfall.
Do we need `:Runtime` from `vim-scriptease`?

###
### From Vim, which commands should I execute to profile a script named `search.vim` in the rtp?

    :profile  start /tmp/profile.log
    :profile! file */search.vim
    :runtime! autoload/search.vim

    " use the plugin, and reproduce the slowdown for which you want to know the cause
    " restart Vim

#### Same question, but from the shell?

    $ vim --cmd 'profile  start /tmp/profile.log' \
          --cmd 'profile! file  */autoload/search.vim' \
          -c    'edit +/\\v%>12v%<34v. file' \
          -c    'normal n' \
          -cquit

###
### When I profile a script from the shell, should I execute `:profile` via `--cmd` or `-c`?

`--cmd`.

Because after `:profile` has been executed, you must still source the script you
want to profile.
Using `--cmd`,  you have the guarantee  that `:profile` will have  been executed
before the script is sourced, which is required.

Note that `--cmd` is  not necessary if the script is  autoloaded, and not loaded
until you invoke some mapping/command.
But still, be consistent; always use `--cmd` to execute `:profile` from the shell.

### How to detect that a profiling is currently being performed?

During a profiling, `v:profiling` is set to 1.

### What to do if I must execute a command which has nothing to do with what I want to profile, during a profiling?

Temporarily pause the profiling:

    :profile pause
    " execute your irrelevant command
    :profile continue

##
## syntax plugin
### How to profile a syntax plugin?

Disable any feature which may interfere, such as `'cul'`, `'rnu'` and folding.

Then:

    :syntime clear
    :syntime on

    " if the buffer fits on one screen, execute `:redraw!` one or several times;
    " otherwise scroll from top to bottom of the buffer one or several times

    :syntime off
    :syntime report

### How to interpret a syntax plugin's profile?

The columns are:

    ┌─────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ TOTAL   │ total time in seconds spent on matching this pattern │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ COUNT   │ number of times the pattern was searched             │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ MATCH   │ number of times the pattern actually matched         │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ SLOWEST │ the longest time for one search                      │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ AVERAGE │ the average time for one search                      │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ NAME    │ name of the syntax item                              │
    ├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ PATTERN │ the pattern being searched                           │
    └─────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The lines are sorted by total time.

# Testing
## Where can I learn how to write tests for Vim?

   - `:help testing`
   - `~/VCS/vim/src/testdir/README.txt`
   - `~/VCS/vim/src/testdir/runtest.vim`
   - `~/VCS/vim/src/testdir/test_assert.vim`

## How can I run a specific test?

If you want to run all the tests in a particular file, use `make(1)`:

    $ cd ~/VCS/vim/src/testdir; make test_vim9_func
                                     │
                                     └ name of the script testing the feature you're interested in

If you want to run a particular test in a particular file, use `vim(1)`:

    $ cd ~/VCS/vim/src/testdir
    $ vim -u NONE -S runtest.vim test_vim9_func.vim bufname
                                                    │
                                                    └ name of the testing function without the "Test_" prefix
                                                      (e.g. "Test_bufname()")

Or set the `$TEST_FILTER` environment variable.  See `~/VCS/vim/src/Makefile`:

   > # Set $TEST_FILTER to select what test function to invoke, e.g.:
   > #	export TEST_FILTER=Test_terminal_wipe_buffer
   > # A partial match also works:
   > #	export TEST_FILTER=wipe_buffer

### Where can I read the results?

    ~/VCS/vim/src/testdir/test.log
    ~/VCS/vim/src/testdir/messages

# Pitfalls
## Why should I always press Enter at the hit-enter prompt when an error is raised while I'm debugging some issue?

To be sure that you don't miss any error message.

Indeed, if:

   1. your errors are raised from a function evaluated in the RHS of an `<expr>` mapping
   2. this function is not defined with `abort`
   3. its body raises several errors

Then,  the errors  are printed  separately.  That  is, *each*  error message  is
followed by a its own hit-enter prompt.

    nnoremap <expr> <c-b> Func()
    function Func()
        invalid1
        invalid2
        invalid3
        return ''
    endfunction
    call feedkeys("\<C-b>")

    Error detected while processing function Func:˜
    line    1:˜
    E492: Not an editor command:     invalid1˜
    Press ENTER or type command to continue˜
    Error detected while processing function Func:˜
    line    2:˜
    E492: Not an editor command:     invalid2˜
    Press ENTER or type command to continue˜
    Error detected while processing function Func:˜
    line    3:˜
    E492: Not an editor command:     invalid3˜
    Press ENTER or type command to continue˜

If at any point you press any key  other than Enter, like `Esc`, `C-c` or `C-l`,
you won't see the next errors.

Actually, if you press  `Esc`, it seems all error messages  are printed, but you
probably won't see  them (it depends on your `'timeout*'`  settings); if so, you
can still  retrieve them  with `:mess`,  but chances are  you won't  think about
doing it, and just wrongly assume that there is only one error.

## An exception has been thrown, and caught.  I can't see from where the error is raised!

First, increase the verbosity level to 2; then to 13.

Starting from  2, Vim will give  a message whenever  it sources a file;  it will
also print a message to tell you what causes the sourcing (e.g. autocmd).

Starting from 16, Vim  will give you the number of the line  in the script which
throws an error.   Be careful: with this level of  verbosity, Vim gets difficult
to use.  So, make sure to set `'verbosefile'` too:

                           v------------------------v
    $ vim +'set verbose=16 verbosefile=/tmp/debug.log' -S /tmp/error_repro.vim +'quitall!'
    $ vim /tmp/debug.log
    " /^Exception thrown

---

As an example, you might find something like this in the logfile:

    line 12: const FILTER_CMD = {
    Exception thrown: Vim(const):E15: Invalid expression: ]},

    finished sourcing ~/.vim/pack/mine/opt/qf/autoload/qf/preview.vim

This says that the error was raised from the line 12 in `autoload/qf/preview.vim`.
Then, you might read:

    continuing in FileType Autocommands for "qf"

This says that  the autoload script was sourced because  of an autocmd listening
to `FileType qf`.

Then, you might read:

    line 52:     catch
    Exception caught: Vim(const):E15: Invalid expression: ]},

    line 53:         return s:Catch()
    line 16:     echohl ErrorMsg
                                Vim(const):E15: Invalid expression: ]},
    line 23:     echohl NONE
    Exception finished: Vim(const):E15: Invalid expression: ]},

    :return  made pending

    line 54:     endtry
    :return  resumed

    <SNR>159_open returning ''

This says that the exception was caught on line 52 in the function `s:open()`.
The `:catch` clause has invoked `s:Catch()`, which has echo'ed the error message
on its lines 16 and 23.

Finally, you might read:

    continuing in qf#open_auto

    line 23:     endif
    qf#open_auto returning #0

    continuing in QuickFixCmdPost Autocommands for "*"

This says  that `s:open()` was  invoked from `qf#open_auto()`, which  itself was
run from a `QuickFixCmdPost` autocmd.

In this example, here is what could have happened:

   - `:helpg` is run interactively
   - `QuickFixCmdPost` is fired right afterward
   - a `QuickFixCmdPost` autocmd calls `qf#open_auto()`
   - `qf#open_auto()` calls `s:open()`
   - `s:open()` executes `:try | copen | catch | call s:Catch() | endtry`
   - `:copen` triggers `FileType qf`
   - an autocmd listening to `FileType qf` calls `qf#preview#mappings()`
   - to find the latter function Vim executes `:runtime autoload/qf/preview.vim`

Finally,  `autoload/qf/preview.vim`  is sourced,  but  contains  an error  which
throws an exception.

Tip: Whenever you find a message like:

    continuing in FileType Autocommands for "qf"
    continuing in QuickFixCmdPost Autocommands for "*"
    ...

You can find out from where the autocmd has been installed with:

    :new|0pu=execute('verbose autocmd FileType qf')
    :new|0pu=execute('verbose autocmd QuickFixCmdPost *')
    ...

##
# Miscellaneous
## What's the difference between `--cmd` and `-c`/`+`?

   - `--cmd` execute a command BEFORE the vimrc is sourced.

   - `-c`    execute a command AFTER the first file is read
           which includes its autocmds and its modelines

`+` is a synonym of `-c`.

## When does an autocmd listening to `VimEnter` executes its command compared to `+'cmd'`?  Before or after?

After.

From `:help startup`:

   > 12. Execute startup commands
   > ...
   >         The commands given with the |-c| and |+cmd| arguments are executed.
   >         The |v:vim_did_enter| variable is set to 1.
   >         The |VimEnter| autocommands are executed.

Try this:

    $ vim -es -Nu NONE +'put =v:vim_did_enter | :% print' +'quitall!'
    0˜

When the  `+` command was  processed, `v:vim_did_enter`  was not set  yet; which
means that `VimEnter` had not been fired.

##
# Debug mode
## What does the debug mode allow me to do?

Step through a sourced file or a user function.
Set breakpoints.

## Does the debug mode have side effects?

Yes.
For example, the display is messed up by the debugging messages.

## Is there an alternative to debug mode?

Yes.

Set the  `'verbose'` options or  use the  `:verbose` modifier to  increase Vim's
verbosity level.

## How to list all breakpoints?

    :breakl[ist]

##
# `:breakadd`  `:profile`  `:runtime`    ‘bpr’
## Do ‘bpr’ accept
### *absolute* file paths?

`:breakadd` and `:profile`, yes.
`:runtime`, no.

### *relative* file paths?   If so, how do they complete the path?

Yes, all of them.

`:breakadd` and `:profile` completes the path using the working directory:

    :breakadd file foo.vim
                ⇔
    :breakadd file cwd/foo.vim

---

`:runtime` completes the path using every path present inside `&rtp`:

    :runtime! file foo.vim
                ⇔
    :so dir1/foo.vim
    :so dir2/foo.vim
    ...

Where dir1, dir2, are in the rtp.

### *patterns*?   If so, which metacharacters can be used?

Yes, all of them.

You can use the metacharacters listed in `:help file-pattern`.

##
## What does `*` match in the pattern passed as an argument to
### `:{breakadd|profile}`?

Any string of characters (including a dot).

### `:runtime`?

In the last component of the path, a part of the filename:

    :runtime! *foo.vim

Before the last component of the path, ONE directory:

    :runtime! */foo.vim
    could source `plugin/foo.vim`˜

    :runtime! */*/foo.vim
    could source `plugin/bar/foo.vim`˜

##
## How do ‘bpr’ interpret `*foo.vim`?   What about `*/foo.vim`?

## Are the two wildcards necessary in
### `:{breakadd|profile} file */*foo.vim`?

No.  One is enough:

                             useless, because a single star can match two things at the same time:

                                 - the path to a directory
                                 - a part of a filename
                             vv
    :{breakadd|profile} file */*foo.vim

                    ⇔

    :{breakadd|profile} file *foo.vim

### `:runtime! */*foo.vim`?

Yes, if you  want to match a file  whose name ends with `foo.vim`,  you need the
second wildcard.
And if  it can be located  anywhere below a directory  of the rtp, you  need the
first wildcard.

    :runtime! */*foo.vim
              ^^
              *not* useless,  because with `:runtime`, a star can  NOT match the
              path to a directory and a part of a filename at the same time

# Issues
## I can't get a backtrace for an internal error!

Try this:

   - start Vim in a terminal
   - in another terminal start gdb
   - in gdb, attach to the Vim process:

         (gdb) attach <PID>

   - set a break point to where the internal error is raised and continue execution

         (gdb) br file.c:1234
         (gdb) cont

   - in Vim, reproduce the internal error; it should reach the breakpoint in gdb
   - in gdb, when the breakpoint is reached, look at the stack using the `bt` command

         (gdb) bt full

## I can't compile Vim.  The configure script gives an error!

Read `./src/auto/config.log`.
Look for the error message in there; it might look like this:

    configure:12143: error: NOT FOUND!
          You need to install a terminal library; for example ncurses.
          On Linux that would be the libncurses-dev package.
          Or specify the name of the library with --with-tlib.

Once found, look for the previous error message (the first one to cause the issue).

For example here:

    configure:12139: gcc -o conftest -g -O2  -Wl,--enable-new-dtags -Wl,-z,relro ...
    /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccP59uKl.o: relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata.str1.1' can not be used when making a PIE object; recompile with -fPIC
    /usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Nonrepresentable section on output
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    configure:12139: $? = 1
    configure: failed program was:
    | /* confdefs.h */
    | #define PACKAGE_NAME ""
    | #define PACKAGE_TARNAME ""
    | #define PACKAGE_VERSION ""

    | int tgetent(char *, const char *);
    | int
    | main ()
    | {
    | char s[10000]; int res = tgetent(s, "thisterminaldoesnotexist");
    |   ;
    |   return 0;
    | }
    configure:12143: error: NOT FOUND!
          You need to install a terminal library; for example ncurses.
          On Linux that would be the libncurses-dev package.
          Or specify the name of the library with --with-tlib.

The previous error is given by `ld(1)`:

    /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccP59uKl.o: relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata.str1.1' can not be used when making a PIE object; recompile with -fPIC

Notice the suggestion at the end:

    ...; recompile with -fPIC
         ^------------------^

So, try to recompile with these flags:

    CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure ...
    ^----------^

## Some global variable is created, but I don't know which script did it!

    $ vim -V15/tmp/log
    :quit

    $ vim /tmp/log
    /g:your_variable

## I install an Ex command in a plugin, but when I start Vim, it's not there!

    $ vim -V16/tmp/log
    :quit
    $ vim /tmp/log
    /YourCommand

Yes, this is (almost) the same answer as the previous one.
The point is, when some interface is wrong because:

   - it contains an incorrect value
   - it should exist, but it does not
   - it shouldn't exist, but it does

And you don't know why that is the  case, a verbose log will tell you everything
Vim did, and why.

Alternatively, you can try to `:vimgrep` your config files.

## I'm trying to profile a script, but nothing is written in the profile file.  Why?

The script must be sourced *after* `:profile`.
So, pay  attention to  the relative  order in which  you execute  `:profile` and
source your script.

    " ✘
    :runtime! autoload/search.vim
    :profile  start /tmp/profile.log
    :profile! file */autoload/search.vim

    " ✔
    :profile  start /tmp/profile.log
    :profile! file */autoload/search.vim
    :runtime! autoload/search.vim

---

    # ✘
    $ vim -c 'profile  start /tmp/profile.log' \
          -c 'profile! file  */statusline.vim' \
          -cquit

    # ✔
    $ vim --cmd 'profile  start /tmp/profile.log' \
          --cmd 'profile! file  */statusline.vim' \
          -cquit

If you use `-c` to execute `:profile`, it will be executed *after* the interface
of your plugins has been sourced, and thus the profiling won't work.

## Why is `:profile start {fname}` dangerous?

If `{fname}` already exists, it will be silently overwritten.
Make sure  to not  mix the name  of the file  where you  want the output  of the
profiling to be written, with the name of the script you want to profile:

    ✘
    :profile start script.vim
    :profile file foo

    ✔
    :profile start foo
    :profile file script.vim

## I've executed `:4 verbose grep! pat .`, but I can't see the exact shell command which was invoked by Vim!

In this case,  the output of the  shell command is temporarily  displayed in the
terminal, not in a Vim buffer.
And if it's long, you may need to scroll back (tmux copy-mode), to see the exact
shell command which was executed at the beginning.

## I've executed `:4 verbose silent cexpr system('grep -RHIins pat *')`, and I have the same issue!

Press `j` then `k`.

The message has been emitted, but not drawn.
Force a redraw by moving the cursor.

    $ mkdir /tmp/test && cd /tmp/test
    $ echo 'pat' >>file{1..5}

        augroup myquickfix
            autocmd!
            autocmd QuickFixCmdPost * cwindow
        augroup END

# Profiling

    :profd[el] ...

Stop profiling for the arguments specified.
See `:breakdel` for the arguments.

---

You must always start with a `:profile start fname` command.
The resulting file is written when Vim exits.
Here  is  an  example  of  the  output, with  line  numbers  prepended  for  the
explanation:

  1 FUNCTION  Test2()
  2 Called 1 time
  3 Total time:   0.155251
  4  Self time:   0.002006
  5
  6 count  total (s)   self (s)
  7     9              0.000096   for i in range(8)
  8     8   0.153655   0.000410     call Test3()
  9     8              0.000070   endfor
 10                               " Ask a question
 11     1              0.001341   echo input("give me an answer: ")

The header (lines 1-4) gives the time for the whole function.
The `Total` time is the time passed while the function was executing.
The `Self` time is the `Total` time reduced by time spent in:

   - other user defined functions
   - sourced scripts
   - executed autocommands
   - external (shell) commands

Lines 7-11 show the time spent in each executed line.
Lines that are not executed do not count.
Thus a comment line is never counted.

The Count column shows how many times a line was executed.
Note that the `for` command in line 7 is executed one more time as the following
lines.
That is because the line is also executed to detect the end of the loop.

The time Vim spends waiting for user input isn't counted at all.
Thus how long you take to respond to the input() prompt is irrelevant.

Profiling should give a good indication of where time is spent, but keep in mind
there are various things that may clobber the results:

   - The accuracy of the time measured depends on the gettimeofday() system
     function.  It may only be as accurate as 1/100 second, even though the times
     are displayed in micro seconds.

   - Real elapsed time is measured, if other processes are busy they may cause
     delays at unpredictable moments.  You may want to run the profiling several
     times and use the lowest results.

   - If you have several commands in one line you only get one time.  Split the
     line to see the time for the individual commands.

   - The time of the lines added up is mostly less than the time of the whole
     function.  There is some overhead in between.

   - Functions that are deleted before Vim exits will not produce profiling
     information.  You can check the `v:profiling` variable if needed:

           if !v:profiling
               delfunc MyFunc
           endif

   - Profiling may give weird results on multi-processor systems, when sleep
     mode kicks in or the processor frequency is reduced to save power.

   - The `self` time is wrong when a function is used recursively.

# profiling

    :profdel file */search.vim

            Arrête le profilage des fichiers dont le chemin match `*/search.vim`.


                                               NOTE:

            Il semble  qu'il faille réutiliser  le même pattern qu'on  a utilisé
            dans `:profile file pat`.
            On ne peut donc pas exécuter:

                    ✘
                    profile!   file pack/mine/opt/search/autoload/search.vim
                    profdel file */search.vim

            Car `:profile!  file` a reçu  en argument un chemin  absolu, tandis
            que `:profdel file` a reçu un glob.
            En revanche, on peut exécuter:

                    ✔
                    profile!   file pack/mine/opt/search/autoload/search.vim
                    profdel file pack/mine/opt/search/autoload/search.vim

                    ✔
                    profile!   file */search.vim
                    profdel file */search.vim

#
#
#
# Todo

If  your Vim  is  slow, but  you  don't know  exactly  which function/plugin  is
responsible, you can still use `:profile` to find it out:

    :profile start /tmp/profile.log
    :profile func *
    :profile file *
    " At this point do slow actions
    :profile pause
    :noautocmd quitall!

Source: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/12216578/9780968>

To document.

---

After a profiling, maybe we should always run `:profile pause` then `:noautocmd quitall!`.

<https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/2019/05/debugging-in-vim/>

We've lost  time debugging dirvish,  because the issue was  not in vimrc  but in
filetype plugin.  How to avoid it in the future?

Edit: You should find a succession of commands loading more and more files.
Example:

    $ vim -Nu NONE
    $ vim -Nu NORC
    $ vim -Nu /tmp/vimrc (with only filetype plugin indent on)
    $ vim

Also, use `:Scriptnames` to see a list of all the loaded scripts.

If there's no problem with `vim -Nu NONE`, but there's one with
another command sourcing more files, then the issue is in one of
the files listed `:Scriptnames`.

What kind of info does the verbose level 16 give access to?

# OBSCURE

:debugg[reedy]

                Read debug mode  commands from the normal  input stream, instead
                of getting them directly from the user.
                Only useful for test scripts.
                Example:

                                           ┌ start in Ex mode

                                                     warnings and error messages.

:0debugg[reedy]

                Undo `:debuggreedy`:  get debug mode commands  directly from the
                user, don't use typeahead for debug commands.

# STARTING DEBUG MODE

To enter debugging mode use one of these methods:

1. Start Vim with the `-D` argument:

         $ vim -D file.txt

   Debugging will start as soon as the first vimrc file is sourced.
   This is useful to find out what is happening when Vim is starting up.
   A  side   effect  is  that   Vim  will   switch  the  terminal   mode  before
   initialisations have finished, with unpredictable results.
   For a GUI-only version (Windows, Macintosh)  the debugging will start as soon
   as the GUI window has been opened.
   To make this happen early, add a `:gui` command in the vimrc file.

2. Run a command with `:debug` prepended.
   Debugging will only be done while this command executes.
   Useful for debugging a specific script or user function.
   And for scripts and functions used by autocommands.
   Example:

         :debug edit test.txt.gz

3. Set a breakpoint in a sourced file or user function.
   You could do this in the command-line:

         $ vim -c 'breakadd file */explorer.vim' .

   This will run Vim and stop in the first line of the 'explorer.vim' script.
   Breakpoints can also be set while in debugging mode.

In debugging mode every executed command is displayed before it is executed.
Comment lines, empty lines and lines that are not executed are skipped.
When  a line  contains two  commands,  separated by  `|`, each  command will  be
displayed separately.

# DEFINING BREAKPOINTS

:breaka[dd] func [lnum] {name}

                Set a breakpoint in a function.  Example:

                        :breakadd func Explore

                Doesn't check for a valid function name, thus the breakpoint
                can be set before the function is defined.

:breaka[dd] file [lnum] {name}

                Set a breakpoint in a sourced file.  Example:

                        :breakadd file 123 .vimrc

:breaka[dd] here

                Set a breakpoint in the current line of the current file.
                Like doing:

                        :breakadd file <cursor-line> <current-file>

                Note that this only works for commands that are executed when
                sourcing the file, not for a function defined in that file.

:breaka[dd] expr {expression}

                Sets a breakpoint, that will break whenever the {expression}
                evaluates to a different value.  Example:

                        :breakadd expr g:lnum

                Will break, whenever the global variable lnum changes.
                Note  if  you  watch  a script-variable  this  will  break  when
                switching scripts,  since the script  variable is only  valid in
                the  script where  it has  been defined  and if  that script  is
                called from several other scripts,  this will stop whenever that
                particular variable will become visible or unaccessible again.

The [lnum] is the line number of the breakpoint.
Vim will stop at or after this line.
When omitted line 1 is used.

# DELETING BREAKPOINTS

:breakd[el] {nr}

                Delete breakpoint {nr}.
                Use `:breaklist` to see the number of each breakpoint.

:breakd[el] *

                Delete all breakpoints.

:breakd[el] func [lnum] {name}

                Delete a breakpoint in a function.

:breakd[el] file [lnum] {name}

                Delete a breakpoint in a sourced file.

:breakd[el] here

                Delete a breakpoint at the current line of the current file.

When [lnum] is omitted, the first breakpoint in the function or file is deleted.
The  {name} must  be exactly  the same  as what  was typed  for the  `:breakadd`
command:

    - explorer
    - *explorer.vim
    - *explorer*

... are different.

Because of  this, if you source  a file you  want to debug with  `:runtime`, you
must pass an absolute path to `:breakadd`:

    " ✘
    :breakadd plugin/search.vim
    :runtime plugin/search.vim

    " ✘
    :breakadd */plugin/search.vim
    :runtime plugin/search.vim

    " ✔
    :breakadd ~/.vim/pack/mine/opt/search/plugin/search.vim
    :runtime plugin/search.vim

Probably because  `:runtime` expands the  argument it receives into  an absolute
path, once it finds a matching file in the rtp.

# :debug-name
## automatic anchors

Vim will automatically adds the anchor `^` and `$` around the pattern.
So, there must be a full match.

## 'ignorecase' is not used

`'ignorecase'` is not used, but `\c` can be used in the pattern to ignore case.
Don't include the `()` for the function name!

## match against full filename

The match for sourced scripts is done against the full filename.
If no path is specified the current directory is used.

## functions

Note that functions are first loaded and later executed.
When they are:

   - loaded,   the 'file' breakpoints are checked
   - executed, the 'func' breakpoints are checked

## Examples

This matches 'explorer.vim' in the current directory:

    breakadd file explorer.vim

---

This matches '.../plugin/explorer.vim', '.../plugin/iexplorer.vim', etc. :

    breakadd file *explorer.vim

---

This  matches   '.../plugin/explorer.vim'  and   'explorer.vim'  in   any  other
directory:

    breakadd file */explorer.vim



The match for functions is done against the  name as it's shown in the output of
`:function`.
For local functions this means that something like `'<SNR>99_'` is prepended.

## How to profile the scripts whose path match `*/autoload/search.vim`, including all functions?

    :profile! file */autoload/search.vim
            │
            └ include all functions

## How to profile the functions whose name begin with `Func`?

    :profile func Func*

## How to profile the functions whose name begin with `Func` and finish with any character different than `a` or `b`?

    :profile func Func[^ab]

## How to profile the functions whose name begin with `Func` and finish with 2 to 5 characters?

    :profile func Func?\\\{2,5\}
