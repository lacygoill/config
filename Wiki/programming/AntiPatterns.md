# When a `return` is inside an `if` clause, the latter should not be terminated with `else`/`elif`.

Usually, there's a difference between these snippets:

    if cond1
        do sth
    if cond2
        do sth else

    if cond1
        do sth
    elif cond2
        do sth else

The difference  happens when  `cond1` and `cond2`  are true  simultaneously.  In
that  case, the  first  snippet  executes both  actions,  while  the second  one
executes only one action.

But this difference disappears when the action is a `return` statement.  In this
case, the first snippet executes only  one action, like the second snippet.  So,
there's no need for an `else` after a `return`:

    if cond1
        return sth
    elif cond2
        return sth else

    â‡”

    if cond1
        return sth
    if cond2
        return sth else

This kind of refactoring is useful to  reduce the indentation level of the code,
making  it  more readable.   The  longer  the 2nd  `else`  clause  is, the  more
noticeable the benefit is.

Warning: That doesn't mean that you can refactor this:

    if A
        ...
    elif ...
        return ...
    else
        B

Into this:

    if A
        ...
    elif ...
        return ...
    B

In the 1st snippet, `B` is only run if `A` is false.
In the 2nd snippet, `B` is run unconditionally.

It's tricky  to find  such "mistakes".  `return` must be  inside an  `if` clause
(which might have started much earlier); not inside an `else`/`elif`.

Besides, the `return` line might not be  right above the end of the clause.  For
example, there might be  a comment or the returned expression  might be split on
multiple lines.

Leave that to your linter.  For Python, `pylint(1)` can find them.

## Same thing for any statement which makes execution jump to another location, like `break` and `continue`.
