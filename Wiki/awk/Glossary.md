## dynamic regex

A regex can be computed by:

   1. evaluating an expression, converted to a string if necessary
   2. using the contents of the evaluated string

A regex computed in this way is called a dynamic regex.

In contrast, a string of characters between  slashes, used as a regex, is called
a *regex constant*.

## output record

Output from an entire print statement.

   > The output from an entire print statement is called an output record.
   > Each print statement outputs one output record, and then outputs a string called
   > the output record separator (or ORS).
   > The initial value of ORS is the string "\n" (i.e., a newline character).
   > Thus, each print statement normally makes a separate line.
