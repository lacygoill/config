# Inspectional Reading
## Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading

1. Look at the title page and the preface.

Read each quickly.
Note especially the  subtitles or other indications  of the scope or  aim of the
book or of the author's special angle on his subject.
Before completing this step you should have a good idea of the subject, and, you
may pause  for a moment to  place the book  in the appropriate category  in your
mind.
What pigeonhole that already contains other books does this one belong in?

2. Study the table of contents to obtain a general sense of the book's
   structure; use it as you would a road map before taking a trip.

It used to  be a common practice, especially in  expository works, but sometimes
even  in novels  and poems,  to write  very full  tables of  contents, with  the
chapters  or parts  broken down  into many  subtitles indicative  of the  topics
covered.
Such summaries  are no longer  common, although  occasionally you do  still come
across an **analytical** table of contents.

3. Check the index if the book has one.

Make a quick estimate  of the range of topics covered and of  the kinds of books
and authors referred to.
When  you see  terms listed  that seem  crucial, look  up at  least some  of the
passages cited.
The passages you read may contain the crux  – the point on which the book hinges
– or the new departure which attitude.

4. Read the publisher's blurb.

It is not uncommon for authors to try to summarize as accurately as they can the
main points in their book.
And if  the blurb doesn't  say anything important, maybe  the book does  not say
anything of importance either.


Upon completing these  first four steps you may already  have enough information
about the book to  know that you want to read it more  carefully, or that you do
not want or need to read it at all.
In either case, you may put it aside for the moment.
If you do not do so, you are now ready to skim the book, properly speaking.


5. Look now at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument.

If these chapters have summary statements  in their opening or closing pages, as
they often do, read these statements carefully.

6. Turn the pages, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages in
   sequence, never more than that.

Always look for signs of the main contention.
Read the last two or three pages at the end of the book.
Few authors are able  to resist the temptation to sum up what  they think is new
and important about their work in these pages.

## Superficial Reading

In tackling  a difficult  book for the  first time, you  should read  it through
without ever  stopping to  look up or  ponder the things  you do  not understand
right away.

In most cases, you will not be able to puzzle the thing out by sticking to it.
You will have a much better chance  of understanding it on a second reading, but
that requires you to have read the book at least once.

What you understand by reading the book through  to the end – even if it is only
fifty percent or less – will help  you when you make the additional effort later
to go back to the places you passed by on your first reading.

Most of us were taught to pay attention to the things we did not understand.
We were told to go to a dictionary when we met an unfamiliar word.
We were told to go to an encyclopedia  or some other reference work when we were
confronted with allusions or statements we did not comprehend.
We were  told to consult  footnotes, scholarly commentaries, or  other secondary
sources to get help.
But when  these things are done  **prematurely**, they only impede  our reading,
instead of helping it.

## On Reading Speeds

A good speed reading  course should teach you to read  at many different speeds,
not just one speed that is faster than anything you can manage now.
It should enable you to vary your  rate of reading in accordance with the nature
and complexity of the material.

No matter  how quickly you read,  you will be no  better off if you  do not know
what you're looking for and when you've found it.

The ideal is  not merely to be  able to read faster,  but to be able  to read at
different speeds and to know when the different speeds are appropriate.

Every book, no matter how difficult,  contains interstitial material that can be
and should  be read quickly;  and every good book  also contains matter  that is
difficult and should be read very slowly.

## Fixations and Regressions

Films of eye movements  show that the eyes of young  or untrained readers fixate
as many as five or six times in the course of each line that is read.
The eye is blind while it moves; it can only see when it stops.
Thus single words or  at the most two-word or three-word  phrases are being read
at a time, in jumps across the line.
Even worse than that,  the eyes of incompetent readers regress  as often as once
every  two or  three  lines –  that  is,  they return  to  phrases or  sentences
previously read.

All of these habits are wasteful and cut down reading speed.
They are wasteful because the mind, unlike the eye, does not need to read only a
word or short phrase at a time.
The mind can grasp a sentence or even a paragraph at a glance – if only the eyes
will provide it with the information it needs.
Thus,  to increase  your reading  speed,  your primary  task is  to correct  the
fixations and regressions.
Once it is done, you'll  be able to read as fast as your  mind will let you, not
as slow as your eyes make you.

To break eye fixations, place your thumb and first two fingers together.
Sweep this pointer across  a line, a little faster than  it is comfortable for
your eyes to move (so  as to use it as a timer); force  yourself to keep up with
your hand.
You will very soon be able to read the words as you follow your hand.
Keep practicing  this, and keep increasing  the speed at which  your hand moves,
and before you know it you will have doubled or trebled your reading speed.

## The Problem of Comprehension

The hand (or some other device) used as  a timer tends not only to increase your
reading  rate, but  also  to  improve your  **concentration**  on  what you  are
reading.
As long as you are following your hand it is harder to fall asleep, to daydream,
to let your mind wander.

Concentration is another name for what we have called activity in reading.
The good reader reads actively, with concentration.

But concentration alone does not really have much of an effect on comprehension,
when that is properly understood.
Comprehension  involves  much more  than  merely  being  able to  answer  simple
questions of fact about a text.
This  limited kind  of comprehension,  in fact,  is nothing  but the  elementary
ability to  answer the question  about a  book or other  reading material: “What
does it say?”.
The many further questions that, when correctly answered, imply higher levels of
comprehension are seldom asked in speed  reading courses, and instruction in how
to answer them is seldom given.

## Purpose of this section

   1. note some text you find difficult to understand

   2. study it until you understand it

   3. note what are its characteristics:

       What is different  about it, that none of  your existing methods
       helped you to understand it quickly?

   4. find a method to understand quickly all texts sharing the same
      characteristics

Note that you shouldn't reverse the order  of the second and third step, because
in practice,  understanding the characterestics of  a difficult text is  part of
the process of understanding it entirely.

This 4-point method is a meta-method.
That is a method to find a method to solve a problem: here, understanding a text
quickly; review it from time to time to improve it (if possible).

You could make the following generalisation:

   1. note a source of frustration

   2. find a solution to make it disappear

   3. note what characterizes the frustration

   4. find a method to  make disappear quickly all frustrations sharing the same
      characteristics

This generalisation is *not* a *meta*-meta-method: it's still a meta-method.
However,  it  applies  to  more problems  than  simply  understanding  difficult
sentences.

## Repetitions

When faced with a long text, try to find repetitions, that is propositions which
are repeated, or which look almost the same (vary little).
From those repetitions,  you can easily extract the structure  on which the text
relies; usually, with this structure, the text is much easier to understand.

Look at `:help try-conditionals`, just below the big example.
Here are the repetitions that you can find there:

   - When no exception is thrown during execution of the try block

   - When an exception occurs during execution of the try block

   - When an exception that does not match any of the patterns specified by the ":catch"
     commands is thrown in the try block

   - When during execution of a catch clause another exception is thrown

   - When during execution of the finally clause (if present) an exception is thrown

And here's the structure you can extract:

   - no exception in try block
   - exception in try block
   - uncaught exception in try block
   - exception in catch clause
   - exception in finally clause

## Too long sentence
### Bring connected parts closer

A  long sentence  is  often  too difficult  to  understand,  when two  logically
connected parts are separated by a long text.

From `:help try-conditionals`:

   > When  a ":break"  or  ":continue"  for a  ":while"  loop enclosing  the
   > complete try conditional or when a ":return" or ":finish" is encountered
   > in the  finally clause, the rest  of the finally clause  is skipped, and
   > the ":break", ":continue", ":return" or ":finish" is executed as usual.

Here:

   > When a ":break"

... is logically connected to :

   > is encountered in the finally clause, ...

But they are separated by:

   > or  ":continue"  for   a  ":while"  loop  enclosing   the  complete  try
   > conditional or when a ":return" or ":finish"

Don't waste your time reading this kind of sentence over and over again.
Reformulate it immediately to make the logical parts *directly* connected.
Example:

   > When a `:break`  [1] is encountered in the finally  clause, the rest of
   > the clause is skipped, and `:break` is executed as usual.
   > If the finally  clause has been taken because of  an exception [2], this
   > pending exception (or command) is discarded.
   >
   > [1]  or `:continue`  for  a  `:while` loop  enclosing  the complete  try
   > conditional or when a `:return` or `:finish` ...
   >
   > [2] or  an earlier ":break",  ":continue", ":return", or  ":finish" from
   > the try block or a catch clause

Here, we  remove the separation  between the logical  parts and replace  it with
[1], which we use as a kind of annotation reference.
We do a similar edit with [2].
We destructure the complex sentence to make it easier to understand.

You could reformulate the sentence in another way.
The point is:
don't devote your energy to understand a too complex sentence;
devote your energy to find methods which will make it easier.
It  will probably  be quicker,  and these  methods will  be re-usable  on future
complex sentences.

### Use acronyms

Also, if the sentence is still too long, you could use acronyms to shorten a list
of items:

   > When a `:break`  [1] is encountered in the finally  clause, the rest of
   > the clause is skipped, and `:break` is executed as usual.
   > If the finally  clause has been taken because of  an exception [2], this
   > pending exception (or command) is discarded.
   >
   > [1]  or `:continue`  for  a  `:while` loop  enclosing  the complete  try
   > conditional or when a `:return` or `:finish` ...
   >
   > [2] or an earlier BCFR from  the try block or a catch clause

Here, we've replaced:

   > ":break", ":continue", ":return",  or ":finish"

With:

   > BCFR

It works really well when this list of items is often repeated in the text.
Use  some quotation  marks around  the  acronym to  make  it stand  out, and  to
indicate it's not an existing word.

## Missing implicit info
### Reorder events in chronological order

From `:help 'go-M`:

   > when the gvimrc file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded

Method to understand this sentence:

1. express, in the present tense, the event related in each proposition:

   > when the gvimrc file is sourced
    the gvimrc file is sourced˜

   > the system menu has already been loaded
    the system menu is loaded˜

2. draw a time axis

         ──────────────────────────

3. position the event of the first proposition on the axis

         ────────|─────────────────
                 ^
                 the gvimrc file is sourced

4. position the event of the second proposition before or after
  (the choice doesn't matter)

         ────────|────────|────────
                 │        │
                 │        └ the system menu is loaded
                 │
                 └ the gvimrc file is sourced

5. re-read the original sentence

   > when the gvimrc file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded

Ask yourself whether it fits with the axis you just drew.
If the answer is no, reposition the event of the second proposition:

        ────────|────────|────────
                │        │
                │        └ the gvimrc file is sourced
                │
                └ the system menu is loaded

6. reformulate the sentence describing the events in their chronological order
   as displayed on the previous axis

   > the system menu is loaded, then, the gvimrc is sourced

7. if necessary, edit the sentence to better preserve the original meaning

Here the original sentence tried to explain that there's no use in disabling the
menu in `~/.gvimrc` because the latter is sourced too late.
Thus, it would be better to reformulate it in one of the following ways:

        (1)

   >                                     v---v
   > the system menu is loaded, and only later, the gvimrc is sourced,
   > which is too late to disable the menu
   > ^-----------------------------------^

        (2)

   > the gvimrc is sourced after the menu  has been loaded, so it can't be
   > used to disable the latter

Even if the last reformulation mentions the events in a non-chronological order,
it's still easier to understand than the original one.
Indeed, after having understood the original sentence, thanks to the first reformulation,
you should have understood its real purpose; something was implicit:

   > you can't use gvimrc to disable the menu because it's sourced too late

In the last reformulation, this idea isn't implicit anymore but explicit:

   > ... so it can't be used to disable the latter
