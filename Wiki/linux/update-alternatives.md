# Miscellaneous
## What's the purpose of `update-alternatives(1)`?

It is possible for several programs  fulfilling the same or similar functions to
be installed on the system.  If another program needs to invoke these functions,
it has to make a good choice between all of these similar programs.

`update-alternatives(1)` aims to solve this problem.

## Why does `update-alternatives(1)` use two symlinks between the link and path of an alternative (instead of one)?

    /usr/bin/editor          → /etc/alternatives/editor
    /etc/alternatives/editor → /usr/local/bin/vim

It allows the  OS to confine the changes  of the sysadmin to `/etc`,  which is a
good thing according to the FHS.  IOW, it creates a convenient centralised point
of config.

Indeed, once  you've installed a  group link,  the first symlink  doesn't change
anymore:

    /usr/bin/editor → /etc/alternatives/editor

Only the second one can:

    /etc/alternatives/editor → /usr/local/bin/vim
    /etc/alternatives/editor → /usr/local/bin/emacs
    ...

## What's the specific order to respect when I pass options and a subcommand to `update-alternatives(1)`?

According to the synopsis in `man  update-alternatives`, the options should come
before the subcommand.   Unfortunately, both look the same: they  all start with
two hyphens.  For example, `--slave` is an option of the subcommand `--install`;
as such, it comes after.

##
# Terminology

Since  the  activities  of  `update-alternatives(1)` are  quite  involved,  some
specific terms will help to explain its operation.

## alternative link

A symlink, like `/usr/bin/editor`,  which refers to one of a  number of files of
similar  function.  In  `man update-alternatives`, it's  also called  “generic
name”.

## alternative name

The name of a symlink in `/etc/alternatives/`.

## alternative path

The name of a specific file in  the filesystem, which may be made accessible via
an alternative link using the alternatives system.

In `man update-alternatives`, it's also simply called “alternative”.

## link group

A set of related symlinks (master link + associated slave links), intended to be
updated as a group.

Its name is the name of the master alternative.

## master link

The alternative link in a link group which determines how the other links in the
group are configured.

## slave link

An alternative link  in a link group  which is controlled by the  setting of the
master link.

## automatic mode

If  a link  group is  in  automatic mode,  whenever  a package  is installed  or
removed, `update-alternatives(1)` is automatically  called – from the postinst
(configure) or prerm (remove and deconfigure)  scripts in Debian packages – to
choose the path with the highest priority for the master alternative.

## manual mode

When a  link group is  in manual mode, the  alternatives system will  retain the
choice of  the administrator for the  master path, and avoid  changing the links
(except when something is broken).

##
# Getting info
## Where does `update-alternatives(1)` write its activity?

    /var/log/alternatives.log

Unless you use the `--log` option:

    $ update-alternatives --log /tmp/log ...

##
## How to make ``update-alternatives(1)`` verbose?

Use the `--verbose` option:

    $ update-alternatives --verbose ...

## How to print all choices for the master alternative path of the link group `editor`?

Use the `--list` subcommand:

    $ update-alternatives --list editor

## How to print the available programs which provide `editor`, and the one currently used?  (2)

Use the `--display` or `--query` subcommands:

    $ update-alternatives --display editor
    $ update-alternatives --query editor

### What's the difference between the 2 methods?

The output of `--display` is human-readable.
The output of `--query` is machine-parseable.

##
## How to print the list of all the names of master alternatives, and how they are currently configured?

    $ update-alternatives --get-selections

Each line contains 3 fields:

   1. alternative name
   2. status (either auto or manual)
   3. current choice for the alternative path

## How to save this list, then restore the configuration of all the alternatives according to this list?

Use the `--get-selections` and `--set-selections` subcommands:

    $ update-alternatives --get-selections >file
    $ sudo update-alternatives --set-selections <file

Usage example:

    # save update-alternatives' state info
    $ update-alternatives --get-selections >/tmp/state_info

    # temporarily modify state info
    $ sudo update-alternatives --set awk /usr/bin/mawk
    $ sudo update-alternatives --set editor /bin/nano
    $ update-alternatives --get-selections | grep 'awk\|^editor'
    awk                            manual   /usr/bin/mawk˜
    editor                         manual   /bin/nano˜

    # restore state info
    $ sudo update-alternatives --set-selections </tmp/state_info
    $ update-alternatives --get-selections | grep 'awk\|^editor'
    awk                            manual   /usr/local/bin/gawk˜
    editor                         manual   /usr/local/bin/vim˜

##
## I've installed a master alternative with 2 choices for the path, and some slave alternatives:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/make 123 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/BB ff /usr/bin/nmap

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/paste 456 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/CC gg /usr/bin/qmv \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/DD hh /usr/bin/rar

    $ sudo update-alternatives --set ee /usr/bin/make

### Here's the output of `$ update-alternatives --display`:

    $ update-alternatives --display ee
    ee - manual mode˜
      link best version is /usr/bin/paste˜
      link currently points to /usr/bin/make˜
      link ee is /usr/local/bin/AA˜
      slave ff is /usr/local/bin/BB˜
      slave gg is /usr/local/bin/CC˜
      slave hh is /usr/local/bin/DD˜
    /usr/bin/make - priority 123˜
      slave ff: /usr/bin/nmap˜
    /usr/bin/paste - priority 456˜
      slave gg: /usr/bin/qmv˜
      slave hh: /usr/bin/rar˜

#### What is its general structure?

It's divided into indented blocks; here, there are 3 of them.

The first block always describes the master alternative.

The other blocks always describe the available  paths in the link group, and the
slaves associated to each of them.

##### How to read the first block?

For the master alternative, the third and fourth lines are the most important ones:

      link currently points to /usr/bin/make˜
      link ee is /usr/local/bin/AA˜

This tells you that:

   - the *link* of the master alternative is `/usr/local/bin/AA`
   - the *name* of the master alternative is `ee`
   - the *path* of the master alternative is `/usr/bin/make`

Which perfectly matches the links managed by `update-alternatives(1)`:

    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/AA
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/AA -> /etc/alternatives/ee˜
    $ ls -l /etc/alternatives/ee
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /etc/alternatives/ee -> /usr/bin/make˜

##### How to read the other blocks?

For a  slave alternative, the  two lines beginning  with `slave <name>`  – where
`<name>` is the name of the alternative – are the most important ones:

    slave ff is /usr/local/bin/BB˜
    slave ff: /usr/bin/nmap˜

This tells you that:

   - the *link* of the slave alternative is `/usr/local/bin/BB`
   - the *name* of the slave alternative is `ff`
   - the *path* of the slave alternative is `/usr/bin/nmap`

Which, again, perfectly matches the links managed by `update-alternatives(1)`:

    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/BB
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/BB -> /etc/alternatives/ff˜
    $ ls -l /etc/alternatives/ff
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /etc/alternatives/ff -> /usr/bin/nmap˜

####
#### Why are the slaves `gg` and `hh` present in the first block, even though they're not used?

Their links need to be remembered in case they get used in the future.

#### What happens to the slave `ff` if I choose `/usr/bin/paste` as the master alternative path?

Its link and name will be removed.

    $ sudo update-alternatives --set ee /usr/bin/make
    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/BB /etc/alternatives/ff
    ls: cannot access '/usr/local/bin/BB': No such file or directory˜
    ls: cannot access '/etc/alternatives/ff': No such file or directory˜

#### On which condition are the link and name of a slave removed when I change the path of a master alternative?

No slave associated to  the new master alternative path must  have the same link
and name.

Consider this:

    $ update-alternatives --query editor
    Name: editor˜
    Link: /usr/bin/editor˜
    Slaves:˜
     editor.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/editor.1.gz˜
     editor.fr.1.gz /usr/share/man/fr/man1/editor.1.gz˜
     editor.it.1.gz /usr/share/man/it/man1/editor.1.gz˜
     editor.pl.1.gz /usr/share/man/pl/man1/editor.1.gz˜
     editor.ru.1.gz /usr/share/man/ru/man1/editor.1.gz˜
    Status: auto˜
    Best: /usr/bin/vim.basic˜
    Value: /usr/bin/vim.basic˜

    Alternative: /bin/ed˜
    Priority: -100˜
    Slaves:˜
     editor.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/ed.1.gz˜

    Alternative: /usr/bin/vim.basic˜
    Priority: 50˜
    Slaves:˜
     editor.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/vim.1.gz˜
     editor.fr.1.gz /usr/share/man/fr/man1/vim.1.gz˜
     editor.it.1.gz /usr/share/man/it/man1/vim.1.gz˜
     editor.pl.1.gz /usr/share/man/pl/man1/vim.1.gz˜
     editor.ru.1.gz /usr/share/man/ru/man1/vim.1.gz˜

If you choose `/bin/ed` instead of `/usr/bin/vim.basic`, the slaves `editor.{fr,it,pl,ru}`
will be removed, because the new master path has no such slaves:

    $ rm /usr/share/man/{fr,it,pl,ru}/man1/editor.1.gz \
         /etc/alternatives/editor.{fr,it,pl,ru}.1.gz

But the slave `editor.1.gz` will be kept; only its path will be updated:

    /usr/share/man/man1/editor.1.gz → /etc/alternatives/editor.1.gz
    /etc/alternatives/editor.1.gz   → /usr/share/man/man1/vim.1.gz
                                      ^--------------------------^
                                      new path

# Configuration
## Where does `update-alternatives(1)` store its state information?

In files inside the `/var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/` directory.

##
## How to choose the path of the master alternative for the link group `editor`
### interactively?

Use the `--config` subcommand:

    $ update-alternatives --config editor

### non-interactively?

Use the `--set` subcommand:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --set editor /new/path

Example:

    $ update-alternatives --set editor /usr/local/bin/vim

###
## How to make the link group `editor` switch to automatic mode?

    $ update-alternatives --auto editor

In the process, the  links of the master alternative is updated  to point to the
alternative path choice with the highest priority; the slaves are also updated.

---

You could also rerun `--config` and select the entry marked as automatic.

##
## How to review all link groups?

    $ update-alternatives --all

### And automatically fix the broken alternatives?

    $ yes '' | update-alternatives --all --force
                                           │
                                           └ Allow replacing or dropping any real file that is installed
                                             where an alternative link has to be installed or removed.

### Review only the ones which are configured in manual mode?

    $ update-alternatives --all --skip-auto

##
## How to add an alternative path to the list of choices that a master alternative can point to?

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install <link>  <name>  <path>  <priority>

If the master link and name don't exist, they're created.

Example:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/make 123

    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/AA /etc/alternatives/ee
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /etc/alternatives/ee -> /usr/bin/make˜
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/AA -> /etc/alternatives/ee˜

### How to associate slave alternatives to this path?

Use the `--slave` option of the `--install` subcommand:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install <link> <name> <path> <priority> \
        --slave <link> <name> <path> \
        --slave ...

You can specify one or more `--slave` options, each followed by three arguments.

Example:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/make 123 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/BB ff /usr/bin/nmap \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/CC gg /usr/bin/open

### What happens if I use
#### a link which is already present in `update-alternatives(1)` state info?

It fails:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA xx /usr/bin/a2ping 789
    update-alternatives: error: alternative link /usr/local/bin/AA is already managed by ee˜

A link can *not* point to a new name.

#### a name which is already present in `update-alternatives(1)` state info?

The old link is removed, and the new one is installed:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/XX ee /usr/bin/a2ping 789
    update-alternatives: renaming ee link from /usr/local/bin/AA to /usr/local/bin/XX˜
    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/AA
    ls: cannot access '/usr/local/bin/AA': No such file or directory˜

A name *can* be targeted by a new link.

###
## How to remove a path choice for a master alternative?

    $ sudo update-alternatives --remove <name> <path>

Example:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/make 123
    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/paste 456

    $ update-alternatives --display ee
    ee - auto mode˜
      link best version is /usr/bin/paste˜
      link currently points to /usr/bin/paste˜
      link ee is /usr/local/bin/AA˜
    /usr/bin/make - priority 123˜
    /usr/bin/paste - priority 456˜

    $ sudo update-alternatives --remove ee /usr/bin/make
    $ update-alternatives --display ee
    ee - auto mode˜
      link best version is /usr/bin/paste˜
      link currently points to /usr/bin/paste˜
      link ee is /usr/local/bin/AA˜
    /usr/bin/paste - priority 456˜

### What happens to the associated slave links?

They're updated or removed.

A slave link is updated if:

   - the removed path choice was used by the master alternative
   - its name is associated to the new selected path

Otherwise it's removed:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/make 123 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/BB ff /usr/bin/nmap

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/paste 456 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/CC gg /usr/bin/qmv \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/DD hh /usr/bin/rar

    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/{CC,DD} /etc/alternatives/{gg,hh}
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /etc/alternatives/gg -> /usr/bin/qmv˜
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /etc/alternatives/hh -> /usr/bin/rar˜
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/CC -> /etc/alternatives/gg˜
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/DD -> /etc/alternatives/hh˜
    # the slaves `gg` and `hh` have been correctly installed

    $ sudo update-alternatives --remove ee /usr/bin/paste
    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/{CC,DD} /etc/alternatives/{gg,hh}
    ls: cannot access '/usr/local/bin/CC': No such file or directory˜
    ls: cannot access '/usr/local/bin/DD': No such file or directory˜
    ls: cannot access '/etc/alternatives/gg': No such file or directory˜
    ls: cannot access '/etc/alternatives/hh': No such file or directory˜
    # the slaves `gg` and `hh` don't exist anymore

### What happens if the master name currently points to this path?

The master name will be either:

   - updated to point to another appropriate  alternative (and  the  group is
     put back in automatic mode)

   - removed if there is no path choice left

## How to remove all path choices for a master alternative?

    $ sudo update-alternatives --remove-all <name>

Example:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/make 123 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/BB ff /usr/bin/nmap \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/CC gg /usr/bin/open

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/paste 456 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/BB ff /usr/bin/qmv \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/CC gg /usr/bin/rar

    $ sudo update-alternatives --remove-all ee

The last command should have the same effect as:

    $ rm /usr/local/bin/{AA,BB,CC}
    $ rm /etc/alternatives/{ee,ff,gg}
    $ rm /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/ee

###
## Which condition must be satisfied for `$ update-alternatives --install` to succeed?

The path of the master alternative must exist, otherwise the command will fail:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/not_a_binary 123
    update-alternatives: error: alternative path /usr/bin/not_a_binary doesn't exist˜

OTOH, its link and name don't have to exist:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/not_a_binary not_a_name /usr/bin/make 123
    update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/make to provide /usr/local/bin/AA (ee) in auto mode˜

---

If  the path  of  a slave  alternative  doesn't exist,  the  command will  still
succeed, but the corresponding slave link won't be installed.

    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/AA ee /usr/bin/make 123 \
        --slave /usr/local/bin/BB ff /usr/bin/not_a_binary
    update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/make to provide /usr/local/bin/AA (ee) in auto mode˜
    update-alternatives: warning: skip creation of /usr/local/bin/BB because associated file /usr/bin/not_a_binary (of link group ee) doesn't exist˜

## How to overwrite a file located where I want an alternative link to be installed?

Use the `--force` option.

Example without `--force`:

    $ echo 'hello' | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/file
    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/file ee /usr/bin/make 123
    update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/make to provide /usr/local/bin/file (ee) in auto mode˜
    update-alternatives: warning: not replacing /usr/local/bin/file with a link˜
    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/file
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/file˜

Example using `--force`:

    $ sudo update-alternatives --remove-all ee
    $ echo 'hello' | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/file
                               v-----v
    $ sudo update-alternatives --force --install /usr/local/bin/file ee /usr/bin/make 123
    update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/make to provide /usr/local/bin/file (ee) in auto mode˜
    $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/file
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/file -> /etc/alternatives/ee˜

---

Note that the alternative is partially installed, even without `--force`.
But since the link is not installed, it won't work as expected.
