   > \- Mystic and Rider - Sharon Shinn *( Perfect in all the ways that mattered to

   > \- Most of David Edding's stories

   > \- The Earthsea cycle *( Ursula Le Grin )*

   > \- The Traitor Son Cycle *( Miles Cameron, a lot of traveling and logistics in
   > this one )*

   > \- Kings of the Wyld *( Nicholas Eames )*
