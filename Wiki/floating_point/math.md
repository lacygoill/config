# How do you convert the fractional part of a real decimal number into binary?

Multiply it by two.
If the result is greater than 1, write 1 and remove 1.
If the result is lower than 1, write 0.
Repeat.

---

For example, here's how you would convert 0.123 in binary representation:

    .123 × 2 = .246
    .0...

    .246 × 2 = .492
    .00...

    .492 × 2 = .984
    .000...

    .984 × 2 = 1.968
    .0001...

    .968 × 2 = 1.936
    .00011...

    .936 × 2 = 1.872
    .000111...

    .872 × 2 = 1.744
    .0001111...

    .744 × 2 = 1.488
    .00011111...

    .488 × 2 = .976
    .000111110...

    .976 × 2 = 1.952
    .0001111101...

    .952 × 2 = 1.904
    .00011111011...

    .904 × 2 = 1.808
    .000111110111...

    .808 × 2 = 1.616
    .0001111101111...

    .616 × 2 = 1.232
    .00011111011111...

# What's the difference between precision and accuracy, when referring to
## a set of data points?

Given a set of data points from  repeated measurements of the same quantity, the
set is said to  be **precise** if the values are close to  each other, while the
set is said  to be **accurate** if their  average is close to the  true value of
the quantity being measured.

The two concepts are independent of each  other, so a particular set of data can
be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither.

## a calculation?

Accuracy is the nearness of a calculation  to the true value; while precision is
the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal
or binary digits.

##
# What's the measurement resolution of a set of measurements?

The smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response
in the measurement.

###
# Set Theory
## What does it mean for a set to be “countable”?

Intuitively:

You  can count/enumerate  its elements  in such  a way  that you  can reach  any
element in a finite amount of time.

---

More formally:

There exists a one-to-one correspondence between this set and the set of natural
numbers; IOW, there exists a method which:

   - can enumerate all of its elements

         s₁, s₂, s₃, ...

   - doesn't contain any infinity  in the middle, so that  you can reach any
     element  in a finite amount of time

For example, this enumeration of the natural numbers proves that the set is countable:

    1 3 2 5 4 7 6 ...
                  ^^^
                  allowed

But not this one:

    2 4 6 8 ... 1 3 5 7 ...
            ^^^
            forbidden

---

Even more formally:

   > A set  S is countable if  there exists an injective  function f from S  to the
   > natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

## How to prove that
### the set of rational numbers is countable?

Imagine them listed in this infinite two-dimensional array:

    ┌─────┬──────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬─────┐
    │     │ 1    │ 2     │ 3     │ 4     │ ... │
    ├─────┼──────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼─────┤
    │ 1   │ ±1/1 │ ± 1/2 │ ± 1/3 │ ± 1/4 │ ... │
    ├─────┼──────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼─────┤
    │ 2   │ ±2/1 │ ± 2/2 │ ± 2/3 │ ± 2/4 │ ... │
    ├─────┼──────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼─────┤
    │ 3   │ ±3/1 │ ± 3/2 │ ± 3/3 │ ± 3/4 │ ... │
    ├─────┼──────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼─────┤
    │ 4   │ ±4/1 │ ± 4/2 │ ± 4/3 │ ± 4/4 │ ... │
    ├─────┼──────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼─────┤
    │ ... │ ...  │ ...   │ ...   │ ...   │ ... │
    └─────┴──────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴─────┘

We need to find an enumeration of all these numbers.

Listing the first line and then the second,  and so on, does not work, since the
first line  never terminates; you can't  enumerate the numbers between  ±1/1 and
±2/1 in a finite amount of time.

But if we list them by diagonal:

    ±1/1
    ±2/1, ±1/2
    ±3/1, ±2/2, ±1/3
    ±4/1, ±3/2, ±2/3, ±1/4
    ...

We get an enumeration.

Indeed, the  table contains all rationals;  so no matter the  rational you think
of, it must be somewhere in the table.

Besides, in this listing, you can reach  any rational number – including the one
you think of – in a finite amount  of time, because the diagonals are all finite
(contrary to the lines and columns).

---

To be able to enumerate this list  without looking at the table, notice that the
sum of the numerator and the denominator  of all rationals in any given diagonal
is constant; and it's increasing by 1  from one diagonal to the next: 2, then 3,
then 4, then 5, etc.

### the set of real numbers is UNcountable?

Use the Cantor's diagonal argument:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument>

Let's assume that the set of real numbers is countable.
It follows that all of its elements can be written as an exhaustive enumeration:

    s₁, s₂, s₃, ...

For example, the start of the enumeration could look like this:

    ┌─────┬───────────────────┐
    │ s1  │ .5032164223981... │
    ├─────┼───────────────────┤
    │ s2  │ .9999261457682... │
    ├─────┼───────────────────┤
    │ s3  │ .0001042507334... │
    ├─────┼───────────────────┤
    │ ... │ ...               │
    └─────┴───────────────────┘

Now, let's build an element `s` by selecting the first decimal in `s₁` plus 1:

    5+1 = 6
    s = .6

then the second decimal of `s₂` minus 1:

    9-1 = 8
    s = .68

then the third decimal of `s₃` plus 1:

    0 + 1 = 1
    s = .681

Repeat the process  indefinitely, by extracting the `ᵢ`th decimal  of `sᵢ`, `+1`
if it's lower than 8, and `-1` if the decimal is 9.

Now, let's  compare the real  number `s` you've just  built with the  123th real
number in your enumeration.
You don't  know what the  latter looks  like, but you  *do* know that  its 123th
decimal is different than the one of `s`.
So, `s` is different than the 123th real number.
For the  same kind  of reason,  `s` is different  than any  real number  in your
enumeration.

But since `s` is a real number, it should be somewhere in the exhaustive enumeration.
This contradiction  implies that the  original assumption  is false: the  set of
real numbers is *not* countable.

# Formulas
## Express euler's number as the sum of an infinite series.  (2)

    e = Σ(1/n!), n ≥ 0

    e = Σ(1 + 1/n)^n, n ≥ 1

Note that any irrational number can be expressed as the sum of an infinite series.

##
## What's the value of
### `1 + a + a^2 + ... + a^n`?

Let's call this sum S.

    (1): a × S =      a + a^2 + a^3 + ... + a^n + a^(n+1)
    (2):   — S = —1 — a — a^2 — ...       — a^n

    (1) ∧ (2)
    ⇒
      a × S — S   = a^(n+1) — 1
    ⇔ (a — 1) × S = a^(n+1) — 1

    ⇔ S = a^(n+1) — 1
          ───────────
             a — 1

### `a^m + a^(m+1) + ... + a^n`?

Let's call this sum S.

    (1): a × S =        a^(m+1) + a^(m+2) + ... + a^n + a^(n+1)
    (2):   — S = —a^m — a^(m+1) — ...           — a^n

    (1) ∧ (2)
    ⇒
      a × S — S   = a^(n+1) — a^m
    ⇔ (a — 1) × S = a^(n+1) — a^m

    ⇔ S = a^(n+1) — a^m
          ─────────────
             a — 1

The previous formula is a special case of this one, with `m = 0`.

#
# Significant digits
## What are the four cases to consider when determining the significant digits in a number?

The number can be:

   - a value known to be exact (e.g. π)
   - a measured quantity
   - a quantity calculated by an addition/subtraction
   - a quantity calculated by a multiplication/division

##
## When is a digit *in*significant?

Only 0 can be insignificant, and only in one of two conditions.
Either it's a leading 0, or:

   - it's a trailing 0
   - the number has no radix point
   - we know from the context that the 0 can't be significant

     Example: we've measured the following quantity:

         q = 1300 ± 10

     The first  0 in 1300 is  significant because it's above  the uncertainty of
     measurement, but not the second 0.

---

All other digits are significant:

   - non-zero digits (1-9)
   - a 0 between two non-zero digits (e.g. 102)
   - a trailing 0 in a number with a radix point (e.g. 1.230)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures#Concise_rules>

### Is one of the 0 significant in 0.01?

No.
Even the 0 after the decimal point is not significant.

### In the absence of any context, where's the last significant digit in the measured quantity 1300?

    1300
     ^
     significant up to the hundreds

#### How to manually change this position?  (3)

Use an overline, the scientific notation, or a trailing dot.

---

Suppose you want to express that 1300 has only 2 significant digits.
You could write either of these:

    13̅00
    1.3 × 10^3

For 3 significant digits:

    130̅0
    1.30 × 10^3

For 4 significant digits:

        ┌ all digits are significant
        │
    1300.
    1300̅
    1.300 × 10^3

##
## When determining the significant digits in a calculation, which numbers should be taken into account?

Only the ones corresponding to measured quantities.
All the other ones should be considered as values known to be exact and ignored;
in particular:

  - integer counts (e.g. the number of oranges in a bag)
  - definitions of one unit in terms of another (e.g. a minute is 60 seconds)
  - scalar operations, such as "tripling" or "halving"

  - actual prices asked or offered, and quantities given in requirement
    specifications
  - legally defined conversions, such as international currency exchange
  - mathematical constants, such as π and e

### Is the Avogadro's number a value known to be exact?

No, because it's known to us only by measurement.

### Is the speed of light a value known to be exact?

Yes, because its value is given by its definition.

##
## Why is the normalized scientific notation the best way to represent a quantity?

A trailing 0 can't be ambiguous, because you never need one.
So, if  you still  write one,  it means it  contributes to  the accuracy  of the
measurement/calculation.

In contrast, a trailing 0 in an  integer such as `1230` is ambiguous, because we
don't know why it was written.
It may be there to get the magnitude  of the quantity right, or to get the right
precision.

##
## How many significant digits should there be in a quantity calculated by a multiplication/division?

As many as the measured quantity with the smallest amount of significant digits.
