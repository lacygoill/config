## card type

In  order for  Anki to  create cards  based on  a note,  you need  to give  it a
blueprint that says which  fields should be displayed on the front  or back of a
card and how; this blueprint is called a card type.

A card type is made of 3 sections:

   - a template for the front of the card
   - a template for the back of the card
   - a styling section to customize the appearance of both faces of all cards

## collection

All the material stored in Anki:

   - notes
   - note types
   - cards
   - decks
   - deck options
   - ...
