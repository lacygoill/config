# I'm trying to compile a markdown file into pdf.  It fails with an error message (command unavailable...)!

If the error message looks like this:

    “Command \C unavailable in encoding TU”!

Read the error message  to find which part of your  original document caused the
issue.  Then, quote it using backtick or a code block (indentation = 4 spaces or
more).  Try to re-compile.
