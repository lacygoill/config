# Purpose: Think of your  favorite mode of transportation, such  as a motorcycle
# or a  car, and make  a list  that stores several  examples.  Use your  list to
# print a series of statements about these items, such as "I would like to own a
# Honda motorcycle".

# Reference: page 36 (paper) / 74 (ebook)

transports = ['boat', 'car', 'plane', 'train']
print(f'I would like to own a {transports[0]}.')
print(f'I would like to own a {transports[1]}.')
print(f'I would like to own a {transports[2]}.')
print(f'I would like to own a {transports[3]}.')
#     I would like to own a boat.
