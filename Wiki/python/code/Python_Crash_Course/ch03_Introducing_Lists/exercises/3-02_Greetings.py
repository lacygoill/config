# Purpose: Start with  the list you  used in Exercise  3-1, but instead  of just
# printing each person's name, print a message to them.
# The text  of each message  should be mostly  the same, but  still personalized
# with the person's name.

# Reference: page 36 (paper) / 74 (ebook)

names = ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo']
print(f'Hello {names[0]}, how are you?')
print(f'Hello {names[1]}, how are you?')
print(f'Hello {names[2]}, how are you?')
print(f'Hello {names[3]}, how are you?')
#     Hello John, how are you?
#     Hello Paul, how are you?
#     Hello George, how are you?
#     Hello Ringo, how are you?
