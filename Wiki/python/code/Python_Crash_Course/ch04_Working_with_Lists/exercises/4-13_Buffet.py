# Purpose: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods.
# Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
#
#    - Use a `for` loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
#
#    - Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the change.
#
#    - The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with
#      different foods.  Add a line that rewrites the tuple, and then use
#      a `for` loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

# Reference: page 68 (paper) / 106 (ebook)
