# Purpose: pass a list of arguments to a function in various ways
# Reference: page 143 (paper) / 181 (ebook)

# You can pass a list of arguments to a function by first packing them into a list. {{{1

#   But lists are passed by reference, not by copy.  Pass a copy if you need the original unchanged. {{{1

# Making a copy  of a list costs time  and memory; and the bigger  the list, the
# bigger the  cost.  Only pass  a copy if  you really need  to; that is,  if the
# function makes the list mutate, and you need to keep the original value.
