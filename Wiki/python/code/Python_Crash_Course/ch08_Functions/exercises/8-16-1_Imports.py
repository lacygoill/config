# Purpose: Using a  program you wrote  that has one  function in it,  store that
# function in a separate file.  Import the function into your main program file,
# and call the function using each of these syntaxes:
#
#     import module_name
#     from module_name import function_name
#     from module_name import function_name as fn
#     import module_name as mn
#     from module_name import *

# Reference: page 155 (paper) / 193 (ebook)

import my_module

my_module.my_function()
#     This is printed from my_function() imported from my_module.
