# Purpose: Make a dictionary containing three majors rivers and the country each
# river runs through.  One key/value pair might be `'nile': 'egypt'`.
#
#    - Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as "The Nile runs
#      through Egypt.".
#
#    - Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary
#    - Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary

# Reference: page 105 (paper) / 143 (ebook)
