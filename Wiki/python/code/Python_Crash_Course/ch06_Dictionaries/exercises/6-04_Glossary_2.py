# Purpose: Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code
# from Exercise 6-3 by replacing your series of `print()` calls with a loop that
# runs through  the dictionary's keys  and values.   When you're sure  that your
# loop works, add  five more Python terms  to your glossary.  When  you run your
# program again, these new words and meaning should automatically be included in
# the output.

# Reference: page 105 (paper) / 143 (ebook)
