# Purpose: Write addition, subtraction,  multiplication, and division operations
# that each  result in  the number  8.  Be  sure to  enclose your  operations in
# `print()` calls  to see the results.   You should create four  lines that look
# like this:
#
#     print(5+3)
#
# Your output should  simply be four lines  with the number 8  appearing once on
# each line.
