# Purpose: Write  more logical  expressions. Have at  least one  `True` and  one
# `False` result for each of the following:
#
#    - tests for equality and inequality with strings
#    - tests using the `lower()` method
#
#    - numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less
#      than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
#
#    - tests using the `and` keyword and the `or` keyword
#    - test whether an item is in a list
#    - test whether an item is not in a list
