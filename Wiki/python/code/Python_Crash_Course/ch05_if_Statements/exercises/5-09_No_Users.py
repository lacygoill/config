# Purpose: Add an `if`  test to `Hello_Admin.py` to make sure  the list of users
# is not empty.
#
#    - If the list is empty, print the message "We need to find some users!"
#
#    - Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct
#      message is printed.

# Reference: page 89 (paper) / 127 (ebook)

usernames = []

if not usernames:
    print('We need to find some users!')
#     We need to find some users!
