# Purpose: Make  a list  of your  favorite fruits,  and then  write a  series of
# independent `if` statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
#
#    - Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it `favorite_fruits`.
#
#    - Write five `if` statements.  Each should check whether a certain kind of
#      fruit is  in your  list.  If  the fruit is  in your  list, the  `if`
#      block should print a statement, such as "You really like bananas!".

# Reference: page 85 (paper) / 123 (ebook)

favorite_fruits = ['banana', 'kiwi', 'grape']
if 'apple' in favorite_fruits:
    print('You really like apples!')

if 'banana' in favorite_fruits:
    print('You really like bananas!')

if 'melon' in favorite_fruits:
    print('You really like melons!')

if 'grape' in favorite_fruits:
    print('You really like grapes!')

if 'berries' in favorite_fruits:
    print('You really like berries!')

#     You really like bananas!
#     You really like grapes!
