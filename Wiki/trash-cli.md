# Commands
## How to install `trash-cli`?

    sudo apt install trash-cli

## How to put some files in the trash can?

    $ trash-put file1 file2 ...
    $ gio trash --force file1 file2 ...

You can use glob qualifiers too:

    $ trash-put file*
    $ gio trash --force file*

Do *not* quote the pattern.
The commands don't know how to expand the glob qualifier.
The shell must be able to do it.

## How to list the contents of the trash can?

To get a maximum of information (date of deletion, full paths, ...), execute:

    $ trash-list


To only read the filenames, execute:

    $ gvfs-ls --hidden trash://

This command is provided by the  package `gvfs-bin` installed by default in some
DEs.

The `gvfs` acronym probably means Gnome Virtual FileSystem.

The main difference between:

   - `gvfs-ls`   vs  `ls`,
   - `gvfs-cat`  vs  `cat`,
   - `gvfs-cp`   vs  `cp`
   ...

Is that `gvfs-xyz` can also work on remote locations.

## How to look for a file in the trash can?

    $ trash-list | grep filename

## How to empty/restore the contents of the trash can?

    $ trash-empty

    $ trash-restore


Before restoring anything, `trash-restore` will display a number-indexed menu to
let you choose which file/directory you want to restore.


It seems that the menu will  only let you choose files/directories deleted below
the current directory.

And only if there aren't several  partitions mounted somewhere below the current
directory.  In which case I suppose there's  an ambiguity on the identity of the
trash can  you want to restore  something from, because each  partition probably
has its own independent trash can.


`trash-restore` is a custom alias.
The original  command is `restore-trash`,  which imo is  a poor name  because it
doesn't use the same prefix as the other commands.

## How to remove all files with the name 'foo' in the trash can?   All files ending with '.o'?

    $ trash-rm foo

    $ trash-rm '*.c'

Note that you must *not* supply a full path to `trash-rm`, only a filename (last
component in the path).

Contrary to `trash-put`, if you supply  a pattern containing a glob qualifier to
`trash-rm`,  you  *must*  quote  it.   The shell  must  *not*  expand  the  glob
qualifier.

## How to remove the files in the trash can, only if they've been there more than a week?

    $ trash-empty 7

## How can I change them?

Edit this file:

        ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf

Also, for inspiration, have a look at:

        https://github.com/gotbletu/dotfiles/blob/5a0c745845c1ecb21d3355d93f5d7ef7c6e94dc2/ranger/.config/ranger/rc.conf

# Miscellaneous

## Where's the trash can of the main partition (the one including the /home directory)?

    $HOME/.local/share/Trash/

# Pitfalls
## How to fix “OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied:  ...” message when executing `trash-empty`?

The trash can contains one or several files which you don't own, or which are in
a directory you don't have write access to.

Raise your privileges:

    $ sudo trash-empty

Or `cd` into  the trash can, search  for the offending file(s),  and remove them
manually (`sudo rm ...`).

## How to eliminate “TrashDir skipped because parent not sticky: ...” message when executing `trash-list`?

The full message looks like this:

    TrashDir skipped because parent not sticky: /media/user/mount_point/.Trash/1000

To eliminate this message, add the sticky bit to the PARENT directory, which here is:

    /media/user/mount_point/.Trash/

You can do so by executing this command:

    $ sudo chmod +t /media/user/mount_point/.Trash/

When the  sticky bit (or  restricted deletion flag) is  given to a  directory, a
user can delete a file/subdirectory inside, only if they own the latter.
