# What are the three steps which must be done before a source code file can be run?

   1. preprocessing
   2. compiling
   3. linking

##
# Compiling
## When do I need to make my code conform to the `C89` standard instead of the `C99` one?

Whenever there's no compiler which is C99-compliant, on the machine where you'll
compile.  It's particularly relevant on  old hardware, embedded systems, and IoT
(Internet of  Things), where  the only  compiler available  might be  old and/or
closed source.

This shows that the compiler is to C what the python interpreter is to Python.
In the  same way your python3  code might not work  if you pass it  to a python2
interpreter,  your C99  code  might not  work  if  you compile  it  with an  old
compiler.

##
## What are C extensions?

Language features and library functions provided by a compiler, and not found in
ISO standard C.

### Where can I find information about the C extensions provided by GCC?

<https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Extensions.html#C-Extensions>

### When and why should I avoid them?

Those  extensions are  specific  to  a compiler.   If  you're  concerned by  the
portability of your program, you need to stick to C89 (or maybe C99).

From “C Programming A Modern Approach”, page 7:

   > Most C  compilers provide  language features and  library functions  that aren't
   > part of the C89 or C99 standards.
   > For portability,  it's best  to avoid using  nonstandard features  and libraries
   > unless they're absolutely necessary.

##
# Syntax
## What are the 5 categories of C statements?

   - the expression statement (just an expression followed by a semicolon)
   - the compound statement (`{ statement1; statement2; ...}`)
   - the selection statements (`if`, `switch`)
   - the iteration statements (`for`, `while`, `do`)
   - the jump statements (`return`, `break`, `continue`, `goto`)

##
## Why does C require a statement to end with a semicolon?

Since statements can continue over several  lines, it's not always obvious where
they end.

### When does C make an exception to this rule?

For compound statements, and directives.

##
## Which influence does the type of a numeric variable have?

It determines the largest and smallest numbers that the variable can hold.
It also determines whether or not digits are allowed after the decimal point.

## What's the typical largest value that a variable of type `int` can hold?

    2^31 - 1

MRE:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <math.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        int var = pow(2, 31);
        printf("%d\n", var);
    }
```
    c.c: In function ‘main’:
    c.c:5:15: warning: overflow in conversion from ‘double’ to ‘int’ changes value
    ↪                  from ‘2.147483648e+9’ to ‘2147483647’ [-Woverflow]
    5 |     int var = pow(2, 31);
      |               ^~~
    2147483647

Rationale:

You can use 32 bits  to store an integer, and one of them  is used for the sign,
which gives you `2^31` numbers.  But `0` is  one of those numbers, so you can go
only up to `2^31 - 1`.

## Why is it better to use the type `int` rather than `float` when declaring a numeric variable?

For better performance and accuracy.

Arithmetic on `float` numbers might be slower than arithmetic on `int` numbers.

Also, the  value of  a `float` variable  is often just  an approximation  of the
number that  was stored in it.   If you store  `0.1` in a `float`  variable, you
might later  find that the variable  has a value such  as `0.09999999999999987`,
because of a rounding error.

##
## When must I write declarations before other statements?

In (and only in) C89.

So, this will work in C99, *and* in C89:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        int var1 = 123;
        int var2 = 456;

        printf("%d\n", var1);
        printf("%d\n", var2);

        return 0;
    }
```
But this will work only in C99 (not in C89):
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        int var1 = 123;
        printf("%d\n", var1);

        int var2 = 456;
        printf("%d\n", var2);

        return 0;
    }
```
---

This is true in a function body *and* in a block body:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        if (1)
        {
            // declarations mixed with other statements: only works in C99
            int var1 = 123;
            printf("%d\n", var1);

            int var2 = 456;
            printf("%d\n", var2);
        }
        return 0;
    }
```
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        if (1)
        {
            // declarations before other statements: works in C99 *and* in C89
            int var1 = 123;
            int var2 = 456;

            printf("%d\n", var1);
            printf("%d\n", var2);
        }
        return 0;
    }
```
## When must my function end with a `return` statement?

In (and only in) C89.

So this will work in C99, but not in C89:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        printf("Hello world!\n");
    }
```
While this will work in C99, *and* in C89:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        printf("Hello world!\n");
        return 0;
    }
```
##
# Data Types
## When is the integer type not suitable for a numeric variable?

When you need  a variable that can  hold a number with digits  after the decimal
point, or a number that is exceedingly large or small.

##
## floats
### What are the 3 types of floats that C provides?

    ┌─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐
    │ float       │ Single-precision floating-point   │
    ├─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
    │ double      │ Double-precision floating-point   │
    ├─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
    │ long double │ Extended-precision floating-point │
    └─────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘

Each of these corresponds to a different floating-point format.

#### When is each of these suitable?

`float` is  suitable when  the amount of  precision isn't  critical (calculating
temperatures to one decimal point, for example).

`double` provides greater precision – enough for most programs.

`long double` provides even more precision, but is rarely used.

#### How much precision do they provide?

This is  not specified by  the C  standard.  That's because  different computers
might store floating-point numbers in different ways.

Although,  most modern  computers  follow the  specifications  in IEEE  Standard
754.  The latter provides two primary formats for floating-point numbers: single
precision (32 bits) and double precision (64 bits).

A number is stored in a form of scientific notation, with three parts:

   - a sign
   - an exponent
   - a fraction (aka mantissa)

The number  of bits reserved  for the exponent  determines how large  (or small)
numbers  can  be, while  the  number  of bits  in  the  fraction determines  the
precision.

In single-precision  format, the  exponent is  8 bits  long, while  the fraction
occupies 23 bits.   Consequently, a single-precision number has  a maximum value
of approximately `3.40 x 10^38`, with a precision of about 6 decimal digits:

                                       biggest possible exponent (*)
                                       vvv
      (1.11111111111111111111111)₂ × 2^127
         ^---------------------^
                 23 bits

    =  (2^0 + 2^(-1) + ... + 2^(-22) + 2^(-23)) × 2^127

          biggest exponent in previous sum
          v
    =  2^(0+1) - 2^-23  × 2^127
       ───────────────
            2 - 1

    =  (2 - 2^-23) × 2^127

    =  2^128 - 2^104

    ≈ 3.4 × 10^38

(*) Even  though the exponent  occupies 8 bits, you  can't go beyond  127.  It's
interpreted by subtracting the  bias – which is 127 for  an 8-bit exponent –
to  get an  exponent value  in the  range `[-127,128]`;  and 128  is interpreted
specially.

####
### If a C compiler finds the floating constant `12.34`, how is it stored in memory?

Like a double-precision float.

#### How to force the compiler to use a different floating-point format?

For single precision, put the letter `F` or  `f` at the end of the constant; for
example, `12.34F`.

For extended-precision, put the letter `L` or `l` at the end (`12.34L`).

###
### This snippet doesn't give any error:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        float x = 12.34;
        printf("%f\n", x);
    }
```
    12.340000

Unless you compile with `-Wconversion -Werror`.

#### But there is a type mismatch in the assignment.  Why no error?

Indeed, `x` is declared as a `float`, while it's assigned a `double`:

    float x = 12.34;
    ^---^     ^---^
    float  != double

But no  error is given  because a  `double` constant is  automatically converted
into a `float` when necessary (by discarding some bits).

#### And yet, omitting `f` after a `float` constant is bad.  Why?

It might cause an automatic coercion which is not wanted.

For example:
```c
    #include <assert.h>

        int
    main(void)
    {
        // OK: 12.34 is converted from `double` to `float`;
        // to match the `float` type in the declaration
        float x = 12.34;
        // *not* OK: x is converted from `float` to `double`;
        // to match the `double` type of 12.34
        assert(x == 12.34);
    }
```
    c.c:7: main: Assertion `x == 12.34' failed.

The  second coercion  is problematic,  because the  `float` constant  in `x`  is
simply padded  with 0's.   But this  padding doesn't match  the bits  which were
discarded  in the  previous coercion.   So, both  the assertion  and compilation
fail.

OTOH, everything works if you specify that the second `12.34` is a `float`:

    assert(x == 12.34f);
                     ^

Because it prevents the coercion of the value in `x` from `float` to `double`.
No padding of 0s is added, and both operands around `==` match.

##
# Standard Library functions
## In `scanf()` and `printf()`, what does the "f" stand for?

**F**ormatted.

Indeed, both `scanf()` and `printf()` require  the use of a **format string** to
specify the appearance of the input or output data.

`scanf()` needs to know  what form the input data will  take, just as `printf()`
needs to know how to display output data.
