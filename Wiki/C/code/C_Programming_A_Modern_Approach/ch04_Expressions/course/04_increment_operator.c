    // Using `++`/`--` as prefix and postfix operators does not always give the same results. {{{
    //
    // Just like `=`, `++` and `--` can be part of a larger expression, and have
    // the same side effect: they change  an lvalue.  But contrary to `=` (which
    // is a binary operator), `++` and `--`:
    //
    //    - are unary operators
    //    - can be used as prefix or postfix operators
    //
    // When part  of a larger expression,  the lvalue is used  (i.e. fetched and
    // *not*  discarded).  The  retrieved lvalue  depends  on how  you used  the
    // operators (prefix vs postfix):
    //
    //    - prefix: the lvalue is changed *before* being fetched
    //    - postfix: the lvalue is changed *after* being fetched
    //}}}

    printf("i is %d\n", i);

    // postfix test

    printf("i is %d\n", i++);
    printf("i is %d\n", i);
    //     is is 1
    //     is is 2


    // the postfix `++`/`--` have a higher precedence than unary `-`/`+`
    i = 1;
    j = -i++;
    printf("j is %d\n", j);
    //     j is -1
    // If the opposite was true, an error would have been given: {{{
    //
    //     i = 1;
    //     j = (-i)++;
    //     error: lvalue required as increment operand˜
    //
    // That's because  `++`/`--` can only  operate on  an lvalue (just  like all
    // assignment operators require their LHS to  be an lvalue); and `-i` is not
    // an lvalue.
