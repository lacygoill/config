// Purpose: compute the remaining balance on a loan after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd monthly payments{{{
//
//     Enter amount of loan: <20000.00>
//     Enter interest rate: <6.0>
//     Enter monthly payment: <386.66>
//
//     Balance remaining after first payment: $19713.34
//     Balance remaining after second payment: $19425.25
//     Balance remaining after third payment: $19135.71
//
// ---
//
// Each month, the balance is first increased by the balance times the *monthly*
// interest rate, then decreased by the amount of the payment.  The monthly rate
// is given by:
//
//     monthly_rate = yearly_rate / 12
//
// ---
//
// Display each balance with 2 digits after the decimal point.
//}}}
// Reference: page 35 (paper) / 60 (ebook)
