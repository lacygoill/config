// Purpose: compute the dimensional weight of a 12" x 10" x 8" box
// Reference: page 20 (paper) / 45 (ebook)

// Definition: dimensional weight.{{{
//
// A  shipping company  cannot base  the  fee of  a  box solely  on its  weight.
// Indeed, a box could  have a small weight, and still occupy  a lot of valuable
// space.  To  avoid losing money, they  need to take  the volume of a  box into
// account.  That's  where the  concept of "dimensional  weight" comes  in (also
// called volumetric weight).
//
// To compute  the latter, the company  divides the volume by  some number.  For
// example, in the US, for international shipments (!= domestic), this number is
// `166`.  It's  expressed in cubic inches  per pound.  The result  is a weight:
// the number of pounds that the box would  weigh if it had a uniform density of
// 1 pound per 166 cubic inches.
//
// The  shipping fee  is based  on the  biggest number  between the  dimensional
// weight, and the actual one.
//
// This lets the company  enforce a minimal density under which  a big and light
// box could easily fall.
