all: ex1 ex3 ex4

# A target can depend on another target.{{{
#
# For example, `all` could depend on `clean`:
#
#     all: clean ...
#
# That is, when `all` is built, `clean`  is too.  That would be useful to remove
# a previously  built binary to  test changes in `ex1.c`.   Otherwise, `make(1)`
# bail out if it finds an existing `ex1` binary:
#
#     make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.
#}}}
# We don't make `all` depend on `clean` though.{{{
#
# Because that's probably not how it  works in most projects.  Instead, take the
# habit of running:
#
#     $ make clean all
#            ^-------^
#            notice that `make(1)` can build multiple targets in a single command
