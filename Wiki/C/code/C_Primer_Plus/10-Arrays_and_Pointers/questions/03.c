// Purpose: In question 1, `ref` is the address of what?
// What about `ref + 1`?  What does `++ref` point to?
//
// Answer: `ref` is the address of its first element, 8.
// `ref + 1` is the address of the second element, 4.
// `++ref` is  not a  valid C  expression, because  `ref` is  a constant,  not a
// variable.
