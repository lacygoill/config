// Purpose: Change the program  `addemup.c` (Listing 5.13), which  found the sum
// of the first 20 integers.  (If you  prefer, you can think of `addemup.c` as a
// program that calculates how  much money you get in 20 days  if you receive $1
// the first day, $2  the second day, $3 the third day, and  so on.)  Modify the
// program so that you can tell  it interactively how far the calculation should
// proceed.  That is, replace 20 with a variable that is read in.
//
// Reference: page 187 (paper) / 216 (ebook)

    int count, sum, max;

    count = 0;
    sum = 0;
    printf("How far should the calculation proceed? ");

    while (count++ < max)
        sum = sum + count;
    printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
