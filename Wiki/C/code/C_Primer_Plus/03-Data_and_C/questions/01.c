// Purpose: Which data  type would you  use for each  of the following  kinds of
// data (sometimes, more than one type could be appropriate)?
//
//     a. The population of East Simpleton
//     `int`, possibly `short` or `unsigned` or `unsigned short`;
//     population is a whole number
//
//     b. The cose of a movie on DVD
//     `float`; it's unlikely the cost will be an exact integer.
//     (You could use `double` but don't need the extra precision)
//
//     c. The most common letter in this chapter
//     `char`
//
//     d. The number of times that the letter occurs in this chapter
//     `int`, possibly `unsigned`
