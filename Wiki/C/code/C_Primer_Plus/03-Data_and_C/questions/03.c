// Purpose: What portable  types might you use  to get a 32-bit  signed integer,
// and what would the rationale be for each choice?
//
//    - `int32_t` (to get exactly 32 bits, provided it's defined for your system)
//    - `int_least32_t` (to get the smallest type that could store at least 32 bits)
//    - `int_fast32_t` (to get the type that would provide the fastest computations for 32 bits)
//
