# What's the syntax to define a key binding?{{{
#
#     <action> <key>
#
# You can bind several keys to the same action via a single key binding:
#
#     <action> <key1> <key2> ...
#}}}
# Where do I find the name of a <key>?{{{
#
# Each key is an X11 keysym name as shown by `xev(1)`, like `Delete`.
# See:
#
#     /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
#
# ---
#
# Note that the case matters.
# For example, for the `+` key, you must write `plus` in lowercase:
#
#              ✘
#              v
#     <action> Plus
#
#     <action> plus
#              ^
#              ✔
#}}}
#   Which modifiers can I use?{{{
#
#    - C for Control
#    - S for Shift
#    - 1, 2, 3, 4 for Mod1, Mod2, Mod3 and Mod4
#
# Usage example:
#
#     C-Delete
#     ^
#     Control
#
# You can also specify several modifiers:
#
#     C-1-Delete
#     │ │
#     │ └ Alt
#     └ Control
#
# ---
#
# If an alphabetical key is written in uppercase, it implies the shift modifier.
#}}}

# Where can I find an example of config file?{{{
#
#     /usr/share/doc/feh/examples/keys
#
# If you don't have the file:
#
#     $ apt download feh
#     $ ar x *.deb data.tar.xz
#     $ tar --extract --file=data.tar.xz --xz ./usr/share/doc/feh/examples/keys
#     $ editor ./usr/share/doc/feh/examples/keys
