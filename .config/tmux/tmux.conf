# What's the meaning of this `if-shell` guard?{{{
#
# The condition `[ "$TERM" != "tmux-256color" ]` is true only the first time our

# So, this part of the guard means: “if this is the first time the file is sourced”.
# This is equivalent to `has('vim_starting')` in Vim.
#
# The condition `[ -n "$DISPLAY" ]` is true only in a GUI environment.
# So, this part of the guard means: “don't source the file if we are in a console”.
# Indeed, I doubt  a linux console is  able to understand any  sequence we might
# want to use.

#     source-file "$HOME/.config/tmux/terminal-overrides.conf"
#     %endif
#
# But it doesn't seem  to work; the guard would not prevent  the file from being
# re-sourced.  I think that's because, in this case, `$TERM` refers to the value
# in the  environment of  the tmux  server process; and  for the  latter, `TERM`
# always matches the outer terminal.

# In my limited testing, moving it above would not cause an issue, but better be
# safe than sorry.

# 'tmux-256color'  the   first  time  our  `tmux.conf`   is  sourced;  otherwise
# `terminal-overrides.conf` would never be sourced.

# Why `-s` instead of `-g`? {{{
#
# Since tmux 2.1, `default-terminal` is a server option, not a session option.

# https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/7382ba82c5b366be84ca55c7842426bcf3d1f521
# Confirmed by the  fact that `default-terminal` is described in  the section of
# the server options in the man page.
# Also confirmed by the fact that it's listed in the output of:
#
#     tmux show-options -s
#
# However, according to nicm:
#
# >     You do not have to use -s or -w for set-option except for user options.
# >     tmux can work it out from the option name.
# >     For show-option you do need it.
#
# So, we could omit `-s`, but I prefer to be explicit.
#}}}
# Why not let tmux use the default value `screen` (for `$TERM`)?{{{
#
# By default, most terminals set `$TERM` to `xterm` because the `xterm` entry is
# present and set in the terminfo db of most machines.
# tmux sets it to  `screen`, again, because it's a popular  entry (more than the
# `tmux` one).
# The `xterm`/`screen` value  implies that the terminal  will declare supporting
# only 8 colors; confirmed by `$ tput colors`.
#
# Because of this,  the theme of some  programs might be off  (including Vim and
# the terminal itself).  We want the terminal to declare it supports 256 colors,
# which anyway is usually true.
#}}}
# Do we need `$TERM` to contain `tmux`?{{{
#
# Yes.  To support italics:
#
# The `screen-256color` entry in the terminfo db doesn't have a `sitm` field.
# IOW, the db reports that screen is unable to support italics, which is true.
# So, if we set `$TERM` to `screen-256color`, when an application will want to
# make some text appear italicized, it will think it's not possible.
# But  it *is*  possible, because  we  use tmux,  not screen.   And tmux  *does*
# support the italics style.
# The solution is to set `$TERM`  to `tmux-256color` so that when an application
# queries  the terminfo  db, it  finds  the field  `sitm` with  the right  value
# `\E[3m`.
