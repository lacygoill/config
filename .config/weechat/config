# Authentication {{{2

# Why should I authenticate with SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)?{{{

# It lets you authenticate *before* announcing your user to the rest of the network.
#
# This prevents  race conditions  such as  your user  being visible  before your
# vhost/cloak is applied, or trying to join registered-only channels before your
# account name gets set.
#
# This might also let you authenticate even if your IP has been banned:

# How to determine whether a server supports SASL?{{{

#
# Alternatively, in the  server buffer, look for the  "requesting" and "enabled"

# Why should I authenticate with CertFP (Certificate FingerPrint) instead of a password?{{{
#
# With CertFP, you no longer need to provide a password:
#
#     /msg NickServ identify <password>
#
# Nor do you need to `/secure` it (so that it's not stored in plain text), which
# requires you to manage an extra ad-hoc passphrase file.
#}}}
# How to determine whether a server supports CertFP?{{{
#
#     /msg NickServ identify <password>
#     /msg NickServ help
#
# In the output of the last command, check the presence of the `cert` command.
# Note that it's  important to be identified,  because `/msg NickServ help` only
# lists commands which your user can  execute; and you can execute more commands
# when you're identified.
#
# Note that  on Rizon, NickServ  does not recognize  the `cert` command,  but it
# still supports CertFP.  It's just handled with a different command (`access`).
#}}}
# How to add my current fingerprint to the certificate list?{{{
#
# First:
#
#     # setting this  option *before* connecting to  the server lets you  add your
#     # certificate without having to specify its fingerprint
#     /set irc.server.<server>.tls_cert "${weechat_config_dir}/certs/<server>.pem"
#
#     /reconnect <server>
#     /msg NickServ identify <password>
#
# Then, on most networks:
#
#     /msg NickServ cert add
#
# On OFTC:
#
#     /msg NickServ cert add <nick>
#                            ^----^
#     # Specifying your nick is not necessary, but still useful.
#     # When  you connect  to OFTC,  providing the  current fingerprint,  you will
#     # be automatically  identified, and  services will  change your  nickname to
#     # <nick>.  This might be useful in the  case where <nick> is already used by
#     # someone else (which  might happen because you can't  authenticate early on
#     # OFTC; the network does not support SASL).
#
# On Rizon:
#
#     /msg NickServ access add fingerprint
#                              ^---------^
#     # "fingerprint" is meant to be typed literally; don't try to replace it with
#     # an actual fingerprint
#
# Finally:
#
#     # use client side TLS certificate for SASL authentication
#     /set irc.server.<server>.sasl_mechanism external

# How to read the fingerprint of my certificate?{{{
#
# On most networks:
#
#     /msg NickServ cert list

#     /whois
#
# On Rizon:
#

# Which type of digest is used for the fingerprint?{{{

# Libera uses SHA512.
# Abjects uses MD5.
# IRCHighWay, OFTC and Rizon use SHA1.

# What happens if I specify the fingerprint with a wrong type of digest?{{{
#
# It will be automatically converted (except on OFTC which just gives an error).

# Tip: Press `M-=` or `M--` to toggle all filters in all buffers, or only in the current one.
# Syntax for `/filter addreplace`:{{{

#                                      v------------v v----v
#     /filter addreplace <filter_name> <buffer_names> <tags> <regex>

#                                      as given by /buffer list
#
# The filter name is used to manage the filter later.
# The buffer names are  matched against the full names of  the actual buffers in
# your WeeChat instance.
# Tags are matched against the lines tags (`/debug tags`).
# The regex is matched against the contents of the lines themselves.
#
# After the filter name, all arguments can  include `*` to match any sequence of
# characters.  And all arguments' items can  be prefixed by `!` to reverse their
# semantics (including the  regex).  For example, `<buffer_names>`  might be set
# to `*,!*#weechat*` to match any buffer except the ones containing `#weechat`.
#
# To specify that  multiple tags must be set simultaneously,  separate them with
# `+` instead  of `,`. For example,  `foo,bar+baz` will match any  line with the
# tag `foo` OR with the tags `bar` AND `baz`.
#
# The regex  is a POSIX  ERE.  Inside,  a literal `!`  and `|` must  be escaped.
# Also, you  can write  2 regexes  separated by  `\t`: one  for the  prefix, and
# another for the  message.  Finally, a regex is case  *in*sensitive; to make it
# case sensitive, make it start with `(?-i)`.

# You  can't  simply  remove  it  with  `/key unbind f1`,  because  it  will  be

#
#     /key bind <key> ""

# Triggers {{{1
# Syntax of a trigger:{{{
#
#     /trigger add <name> <hook> ["<arguments>" ["<conditions>" ["<regex>" ["<command>"]]]]
#
# ---
#
# `<hook>` can be any name used as a suffix in a `hook_*()` function.
#
# See: https://weechat.org/files/doc/weechat/stable/weechat_plugin_api.en.html#hooks
#
# ---
#
# The semantics of `<arguments>` depends on the hook.
# If several arguments need to be passed, they must be separated with semicolons.
#
# https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#trigger_hook_arguments
#
# ---
#
# `<conditions>` determines whether the trigger is executed.
#
# https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#trigger_conditions
# https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#trigger_callback_data
# https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#command_weechat_eval
#
# ---
#
# By default, `<regex>` is actually one or several substitution commands:
#
#     s/pat/rep/ [...]
#
# https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#trigger_regex
#}}}
# When a line is printed in a buffer, hooks are called in this order:{{{
#
#    - `line`: can change the buffer, prefix, message, tags, notify level, ...
#      on any buffer (even one with free content)
#
#    - `modifier "weechat_print"`: can change the prefix and message on
#      a buffer with formatted content
#
#    - `print`: called when the line has been added in a buffer with formatted
#      content (can't change the line)
#}}}
# Tip: To debug triggers:{{{
#
#     # list all triggers
#     /trigger list[full]
#
#     # monitor given trigger
#     /trigger monitor <trigger_name>
#
#     # read arguments of given trigger
#     /set trigger.trigger.<trigger_name>
#
# The output of `/trigger list[full]` might contain some special tokens:
#
#    - `=?`: the trigger depends on a condition
#    - `~N`: the trigger executes N substitution (`s///`) or translation (`y///`) commands
#    - `/N`: the trigger executes N WeeChat commands (`/cmd`; e.g. `/exec`)
#}}}

# Warning: Set priorities so that modifiers play nicely with each other.{{{
#
#     /trigger add <name> modifier "123|weechat_print" ...
#                                   ^^^
#                                   priority
#
# Hooks are executed in descending order of priority.
#
# The default priority is 1000.
#
# ---
#
# You want  modifiers which affect  the entirety of a  message to have  a higher
# priority.  For example, we need to  set `color_url` with a lower priority than
# `color_my_msg` so that when we paste a URL, it's colored in blue (not in pink).
# More generally,  the more  "specific" a  modifier is,  the lower  its priority
# should be:
#
#       modifier affecting single character
#     < modifier affecting single word
#     < modifier affecting whole message
#
# This  way, a  specific  modifier can  locally  undo the  effect  of a  general
# modifier.
#
# Note that  a URL is  more specific than a  codespan, even though  in practice,
# it's often  longer.  That's because  a URL can  be embedded inside  a codespan
# (the reverse is not true).
#}}}
# Warning: Do not execute modifiers on backlog messages.{{{
#
# By default,  backlog messages are  dimmed; reading some colorized  text inside
# (e.g. URL) would  be jarring.  Besides, you  would need to restore  the dimmed
# color for the subsequent text (which seems tricky).
#}}}

# In a trigger's conditions, always bound a tag name with commas.{{{
#
#                    v              v

#
# That's probably more  reliable, because it avoids  a match in the  middle of a
# different tag; we want an exact match  (same difference in a Vim regex between
# the bounded `\<word\>` pattern and the unbounded `word`).
#
# Don't worry, these added commas won't prevent a match:

#    - `/buffer set notify <level>` creates `weechat.notify.<buffer>`; no

# To  avoid  WeeChat loading  an  old  `.so`  plugin  which we  compiled  during
# a  past  installation, but  then  forgot  to  remove.  Unless  blacklisted  in
# `weechat.plugin.autoload`, WeeChat loads  any `.so` plugin file  that it finds
# in `~/.local/lib/weechat/plugins/`.

# To enable core files of unlimited sizes (useful to debug crash):
#
#     /set weechat.startup.sys_rlimit "core:-1"
#
# To get the list of all possible resources, see `man getrlimit /^\s*RLIMIT_`.{{{
#
# For each  occurrence, take the  name after the underscore,  and use it  in its
# lowercase form.  For example, from the `RLIMIT_CPU` occurrence, you can derive
# the `cpu` resource name.
#}}}
# `-1` is a special value which stands for the absence of any limit.
# You can specify limits for multiple resources:{{{
#
#     "resource1:limit1,resource2:limit2,..."
#

#
# As an example, to  set an unlimited size for core files  and limit the virtual
# memory to 1GB, you would execute:
#
#     /set weechat.startup.sys_rlimit "core:-1,as:1000000000"
