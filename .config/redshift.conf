; Run `$ redshift -m list` to see all possible values.

; cases when "randr" does not.
; The adjustment method settings are in a dedicated section.

; fade {{{2

; Disable the smooth fade between temperatures when Redshift starts and stops.
; `0` will cause an immediate change between screen temperatures.
; `1` will gradually apply the new screen temperature over a couple of seconds.

; gamma {{{2

; Set the screen gamma for all colors.{{{
;
; 1.0 is the normal (uncorrected) gamma  value.  Setting a lower gamma increases
; the contrast of  bright luminances, which makes midtones  darker and decreases
; white washing.  Setting  a higher gamma makes midtones  brighter and increases
; the contrast of dark luminances, but also increases white washing.

;     # note the original gamma correction
;     $ xgamma

;     # test an arbitrary new value
;     $ xgamma -gamma <GAMMA_CORRECTION>

; below elevation-low it is considered night.
