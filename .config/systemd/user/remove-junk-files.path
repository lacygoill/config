[Unit]
Description=Remove useless files frequently created by some programs
# NOTE: Use this unit, and its associated `.service`, to delete more files if necessary.{{{
#
# To test the unit:
#
#     $ journalctl --user --boot=-0 --no-hostname --pager-end --unit=remove-junk-files.service --follow
#
#     # open another terminal
#     $ vim -Nu NONE
#     # search some pattern, then quit
#     # these lines should get appended in the journal:
#     [...] systemd[...]: Started Remove useless files frequently created by some programs.
#     [...] systemd[...]: remove-junk-files.service: Succeeded.
#}}}

[Path]

# Even though we reset `viminfofile`  to `~/.local/share/vim/info` in our vimrc,
# Vim might still create `~/.viminfo` when we debug an issue (e.g. `-Nu NONE`).
PathExists=%h/.viminfo
# FIXME: Often, the file is not deleted, because the service is not triggered.{{{
#
# Using `PathModified` instead of `PathChanged` does not help.
#
# I can reproduce  without triggering the service too quickly;  that is, without
# exceeding the limits imposed by `StartLimitIntervalSec` and `StartLimitBurst`:
#
#     $ journalctl --user --boot=-0 --no-hostname --pager-end --unit=remove-junk-files.service --follow
#     # these messages are *not* printed
#     [...]: Start request repeated too quickly.
#     [...]: Failed with result 'start-limit-hit'.
#     [...]: Failed to start ...
#}}}
PathModified=%h/.viminfo

# Each  time we  log in,  one more  empty `config-err-*`  file is  created under
# `/tmp`.  Not sure what  its purpose is, but it's distracting  in the output of
# `ls(1)`.
PathExistsGlob=/tmp/config-err-*
