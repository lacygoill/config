# intermediate  file  (â‰ˆ contents  of  the  markdown  file  written in  a  LaTeX
# document).
# As a  result, the line  error doesn't match the  one in the  original markdown
# file.

# Where could I add `--`?{{{
#
# Right in front of `%:p:S`.
#}}}
# Why would I do it?{{{
#
# To avoid an error in case the filename begins with a hyphen.
#}}}
# Why don't you do it then?{{{
#
# There's no need to.
# We use `:p` which makes the filepath absolute, and thus begin with a `/`.
