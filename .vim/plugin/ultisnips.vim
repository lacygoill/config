# Mappings {{{1

# Why not `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>`?{{{
#
# It would make our code much more  complex because we would have to work around
# various mappings  installed by Ultisnips  (including temporary ones,  local to
# the buffer).  It's much simpler to prevent UltiSnips from interfering entirely
# with what we  want to do with  `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>`.  So, we  feed it useless
# keys.
#}}}
# OK, but why S-F7..9 ? {{{
#
# We're looking for unused keys, which will stay unused in the future.
# Currently, the maximum value `xx` to create a `<F-xx>` LHS is `37`:
# https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/8858498516108432453526f07783f14c9196e112/src/keymap.h#L194
#
# Beyond  this value,  creating a  mapping would  shadow the  `<` key,  probably
# because it's not interpreted as a function key anymore.

# Remove select mode mappings using printable characters {{{

# From `:help mapmode-s`:
#
#    > Some commands work both in Visual and Select mode, some in only one.
#    > Note that quite often "Visual" is mentioned where both Visual and Select
#    > mode apply.
#    > NOTE: Mapping a printable character in Select mode may confuse the user.
#    > It's better to explicitly use :xmap, and :smap for printable characters.
#    > Or use :sunmap after defining the mapping.
#
# It probably implies that mapping a printable character in select mode is a bad
# idea.  For example, suppose that a plugin install this mapping:
#
#     :snoremap z abc
#
# When the user will hit `z` in select mode, he will expect the selected text
# to be replaced by the `z` character.
# But in fact, the selected text will be replaced by `abc`.
# This unexpected behavior can happen because some plugins use the `:v(nore)map`
# command instead of `:x(nore)map`.
#
# It could pose a pb for UltiSnips, when a tabstop is selected and we hit some
# character to  replace the  selection.  Therefore, by  default, each  time we
# expand a tab  trigger, UltiSnips removes all the select  mode mappings whose
# LHS is a printable character.
#
# We like that (no printable character in a select mode mapping):

# That's exactly what `UltiSnips#SaveLastVisualSelection()` is.
