#                        |              stands for the regex .*

#                          It  works  even though,  atm,  our  error messages  are  not
#                          multi-line, which  seems to indicate  that %E can work  on a
#                          single line error message too.
#
#                          The `+` includes the whole matching line in the %m error string.
#                          It works even  though we don't use any `%m`,  which seems to
#                          indicate that you don't need a `%m` in a format using `%+`.

# This value is useful for an error like this:
#
#     Error: /tmp/file.dot: syntax error in line 40 near '['Ëœ
