    # Corner Case:{{{
    #
    # Create a tab  page with a qf  window + a terminal.  The  terminal is big
    # when we switch to  the qf window, then small when we  switch back to the
    # terminal.
    #
    # More generally, I think this  undesired change of height occurs whenever
    # we move  in a tab  page where there are  several windows, but  *all* are
    # special.  This  is a unique and  probably rare case.  So,  I don't think
    # it's worth trying and fix it.
    #}}}

    # Why the `&l:previewwindow` guard?{{{
    #
    # Suppose we  preview a file from  a file explorer.  Chances  are the file
    # explorer, and thus the preview window, are not horizontally maximized.
    #
    # If we  focus the preview window,  its height won't be  set, because it's
    # not horizontally  maximized.  As  a result,  it will  be treated  like a
    # regular window and maximized.  We don't want that.
    #}}}
    #   OK, but how will the height of a preview window will be set then?{{{
    #
    # The preview window is a special case.
    # When you open one, 2 WinEnter are fired; when Vim:
    #
    #    1. enters the preview window (`&l:previewwindow` is *not* yet set)
    #    2. goes back to the original window (now, `&l:previewwindow` *is* set in the preview window)
    #
    # When the first WinEnter is fired, `&l:previewwindow` is not set.
    # Thus, the function should maximize it.
    #
    # When the  second `WinEnter`  is fired,  we'll get  back to  the original
    # window.  It'll probably be a regular  window, and thus be maximized.  As
    # a result, the preview window will  be minimized (1 line high).  But, the
    # code  at the  end of  this  function should  restore the  height of  the
    # preview window.
    #
    # So, in the end, the height of the preview window is correctly set.

    # more than what we expect.

    # MRE:
    #
    #     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set scrolloff=3 | helpgrep foobar' +'cwindow | :2 quit'
    #     :clast | wincmd _ | :2 resize 10
    #     :call win_execute(win_getid(2), "normal! \<C-Y>")
    #
    # After the first Ex command, the last line of the qf buffer is the topline.
    # The second Ex  command should scroll one line upward;  but in practice, it
    # scrolls 4 lines upward (`1 + &scrolloff`).
    #
    # It could be a bug, because I can't always reproduce.
    # For example, if you scroll back so that the last line is again the topline:
    #
    #     :call win_execute(win_getid(2), "normal! 4\<C-E>")
    #
    # Then, invoke `win_execute()` exactly as  when you triggered the unexpected
    # scrolling earlier:
    #
    #     :call win_execute(win_getid(2), "normal! \<C-Y>")
    #
    # This time, Vim scrolls only 1 line upward.
    #
    # ---
    #
    # Sth else is weird:
    #
    #     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set scrolloff=3 | helpgrep foobar' +'cwindow | :2 quit'
    #     :clast
    #
    # The last line of the qf buffer is the *last* line of the window.
    #
    #     :wincmd _ | :2 resize 10
    #
    # The last line of the qf buffer is the *first* line of the window.
    #
    #     :wincmd w | execute "normal! 6\<C-Y>" | wincmd w
    #
    # The last line of the qf buffer is the last line of the window.
    #
    #     :wincmd _ | :2 resize 10
    #
    # The last line of the qf buffer is *still* the last line of the window.
    #
    # So, we have a unique command (`:wincmd _ | :2 resize 10`) which can have a
    # different effect on  the qf window; and  the difference is not  due to the

# Purpose:{{{
#
# When you split a window, by default, all the windows are automatically resized
# to have the same height.
# Also when you close a window; although,  this doesn't seem to be the case when
# you close a help window.
#
# This  is annoying  in  various  situations, because  it  can *un*maximize  the
# current window, and *un*squash the non-focused windows.
#
# For example, suppose that:
#
#    - you have 2 horizontal splits
#    - you open our custom file explorer fex (`-t`)
#    - you move your cursor on a file path
#    - you open it in a vertical split (`C-w f`)
#    - you close the latter (`:quit`)
#
# The original 2 horizontal splits are unexpectedly resized.
#
# All of this  shows that it's a general issue which can  affect you in too many
# circumstances.
# Trying to handle  each of them is a  waste of time; let's fix  the root cause;
# let's disable `'equalalways'`.
#}}}
&equalalways = false
# Which pitfall should I be aware of when resetting `'equalalways'`?{{{
#
# It  can cause  `E36` to  be given  whenever you  try to  visit a  qf entry  by
# pressing Enter in the qf window, while the latter is only 1 line high.
#
# Example:
#
#     $ vim +'helpgrep Arthur!'
#     :resize 1
#     # press Enter
#
# Indeed, Vim tries to split the qf window to display the entry.
# But if  the window is only  1 line high, and  Vim can't resize any  window, it
# can't make more room for the new one.
#
# MRE:
#
#     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set noequalalways' +'autocmd QuickFixCmdPost * botright cwindow 2' +'helpgrep readnews'
#     E36: Not enough room˜
#
#     $ vim -Nu NONE +'set noequalalways | :2 split | split'
#     E36: Not enough room˜
#
# In the last example, the final `:split` gives `E36`, because:
#
#    - creating a second window would require 2 lines
#      (one for the text – because `'winminheight'` is 1 – and one for the status line)
#
#    - the top window would still need 2 lines (one for the text, and one for its status line)
#
#    - the top window occupies 3 lines, which is not enough for 2 + 2 lines;
#      it needs to be resized, but Vim can't because `'equalalways'` is reset
#
# ---
#
# That's why  we make sure –  here and in `vim-qf`  – that the qf  window is
# always at least `&winminheight + 2` lines high.
#}}}

# Why setting `'splitbelow'` and `'splitright'`?{{{
#
# When opening a file with long lines, I prefer to do it:
#
#    - on the right if it's vertical
#    - at the bottom if it's horizontal
#
# Rationale:
# When you read a book, the next page is on the right, not on the left.
# When you read a pdf, the next page is below, not above.
#
# ---
#
# However, when displaying a  buffer with short lines, I prefer to  do it on the
# left.
#
# Rationale:
# When you write annotations in a page, you do it in the left margin.
#
# ---
#
# Bottom Line:
# `set splitbelow` and `set splitright`  seem to define good default directions.
# Occasionally though,  we might need  `:topleft` or `:leftabove` to  change the
# direction.
#}}}
# when we create a new horizontal viewport, it should be displayed at the bottom of the screen
&splitbelow = true
# and a new vertical one should be displayed on the right
&splitright = true

# let us squash an unfocused window to 0 lines
&winminheight = 0
# let us squash an unfocused window to 0 columns (useful when we zoom a window with `SPC z`)

    # TODO: It causes an issue with some of our commands/mappings; like `!m` for example.
    #
    # This is because  `debug#log#Output()` runs `:wincmd P`  which is forbidden
