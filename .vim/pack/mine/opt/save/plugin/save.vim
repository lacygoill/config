# What does `'autoread'` do?{{{
#
# When  a file  is detected  to have  been changed  outside of  the current  Vim
# instance but not changed inside the latter, automatically read it again.
# Basically, it answers `Yes`, to the question where we usually answer `Load`.
#}}}
# When does Vim check whether a file has been changed outside the current instance?{{{
#
# In the terminal, when you:
#
#    - try to write the buffer
#    - execute a `:!` command
#    - execute `:checktime`
#    (without argument or with an argument matching the changed file)
#
# Also when you give  the focus to a Vim instance where the  file is loaded; but
# only in  the GUI,  or in a  terminal which supports  the focus  event tracking
# feature, such as xterm (and if `'t_fd'` and `'t_fe'` are correctly set).
# See `:help xterm-focus-event`.
