# `--ignore-case`: search case-insensitively{{{
#
# Note that  if your search  pattern contains  an uppercase character,  the case
# WILL still be taken into account.
#
# It's like 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' in Vim.
#}}}
# `--LONG-PROMPT`: make prompt more verbose{{{
#
# At  the bottom  of  the screen,  it  prints  info about  our  position with  a
# percentage, and line numbers.
#}}}
# `--mouse`: enable mouse scrolling{{{
#
# This also has the side effect of disabling selecting text with the mouse.
# As a workaround, hold `Shift` while moving the mouse.
# Once your  text is  selected, press  the middle button  to paste  anywhere (in
# Tmux, you need to simultaneously hold `Shift`).  In Vim's normal mode, use the
# star register.
#}}}
# `--quit-if-one-screen`: exit if entire file can be displayed on first screen{{{
#
# This lets us avoid some quirk:
#
#    - open a file with fewer lines than the height of the terminal screen
#      (actually just a few), with at least one of them longer than the
#      terminal width
#
#    - press `L` to scroll horizontally and read the rest of the long line
#
# Expected: The lines scroll without their vertical position changing.
# Actual: The lines are moved to the very top of the screen.
# This makes us  lose whatever was printed on the  terminal before `less(1)` was
# run, and uselessly appends a lot of empty lines at the bottom of the screen.
#
# ---
#
# Issue: `--quit-if-one-screen`  can cause an  issue if `less(1)` is  invoked by
# another program.   In particular, if `less(1)`  is invoked by ranger  when you
# open an archive file (e.g. `.tar.gz`), and  if the archive contains only a few
# files,  `less(1)` will  quit immediately  and you  won't be  able to  read its
# contents (unless  you enable the preview  feature for archive files,  but this
# can cause another issue specific to ranger).
#
# As a  workaround, use `-+F` to  disable the option when  needed (actually it's
# reset to its default value, which is disabled).
#
# ---
#
# Issue: `--quit-if-one-screen`  does not  work with  `--chop-long-lines` (which
# prevents long lines from being wrapped).
#}}}
# `--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS`: do not display caret notation of control characters used in ANSI color escape sequences{{{
#
# Instead, they're sent in raw form to the terminal which will interpret them to
# set the colors of the text appropriately.
#
# This is useful for commands such as `$ git log`.
# Without, you would see things like `ESC[33m ... ESC[m`.
#
# If you still see control characters, you can use `r` instead of `R`.
# However, from `man less`:
#
# >     Warning: when the  -r option is used,  less cannot keep track  of the actual
# >     appearance of the  screen (since this depends on how  the screen responds to
# >     each type of control character).
# >     Thus, various display problems may result, such as long lines being split in
# >     the wrong place.

#
# You can adapt the statements to fish:
#
#     set --export LESSOPEN '| /usr/bin/lesspipe %s'
#     set --export LESSCLOSE '/usr/bin/lesspipe %s %s'
#
# Now, when you'll  try to open an archive file,  `lesspipe` will pre-process it
# and write its uncompressed text on a pipe which `less(1)` will read.
#
# For more information, see `man lesspipe` or `man lessopen`.
#}}}

# But we prefer `lesspipe.sh`: https://github.com/wofr06/lesspipe/releases

#
# Basically, it's as if sh executed something like:
#
#     $ export SHELL="$(awk -F: '$1 == ENVIRON["USER"] { print $NF }' /etc/passwd)"
#}}}
# That said, we keep this section to remember how important `$SHELL` is.{{{
#
# In  particular, make  sure it's  never set  to your  usual interactive  shell.
# `$SHELL`  is often  used to  run scripted  code, for  which bash  is the  most
# sensible choice.
#
# For example, whenever we use fzf to run some shell code:
#
#     ... --preview='shell code'
#
# fzf uses `$SHELL` as the interpreter:
#
#    > On unix systems, **fzf runs the command with $SHELL -c if SHELL is set**, [...]
#
# Source: `man fzf /KEY/EVENT BINDINGS/;/COMMAND EXECUTION/;/SHELL`
#
# And we  often write bash  scripts invoking fzf.  If  we set `$SHELL`  to fish,
# then  we would  need to  write fish  code inside  bash scripts,  which is  too
# confusing.  Alternatively, we could write this at the top of our scripts:
#
#     SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
#
# But it  seems too cumbersome  and unreliable (easy  to forget, then  get weird
# errors).
#
# Same  deal  with  various  Vim  commands/functions  (`!`,  `:!`,  `:terminal`,
# `system()`, ...).
#

#
# This can be an  issue for an installation script which needs  to extract a big
# archive into a temporary directory.  Or for `mkinitramfs(8)`.
#
# ---
#
# If you really wanted to use `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, you could increase the size of
# the  filesystem  mounted  on  `/run`  by re-setting  the  value  of  `RUNSIZE`
# in  `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/99-local.conf`.   Then,  you  would  need  to
# re-generate `/boot/initrd.img`:
#
#     $ sudo update-initramfs -u
#
# Finally, you  would need  to increase  the size of  the filesystem  mounted on
# `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`  by  re-setting  the  value  of  `RuntimeDirectorySize`  in
# `/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/99-local.conf` (see `man 5 logind.conf`):
#
#     [Login]
#     RuntimeDirectorySize=...
#
# Also, you  would need to make  sure that `RuntimeDirectorySize` is  lower than
# `RUNSIZE`; otherwise, no filesystem is mounted on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
#
# But all of this seems too  complex.  Besides, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is mounted as
# a "tmpfs" instance (see `man 5 filesystems`).  That is, its contents reside in
# virtual  memory.  IOW,  it  consumes  your RAM,  and  if  necessary your  swap
# space.  To keep a stable system, don't increase the default value of `RUNSIZE`
